        <p>Jesus College May Ball is currently looking for motivated and enthusiastic workers to help make this year's Ball a huge success.</p>
        <p>There are a variety of roles available, including Food and Drink workers, Security Stewards, and Entertainment Runners, as well as opportunities to take on a leadership position as a Team Leader or Court Supervisor.</p>
        <p>We do not operate a 'half-on, half-off' employment policy like many May Balls, and workers are offered a competitive rate which starts at &pound;80 for the night and increases for certain roles.</p>
        <p>Applicants must be willing to work as part of a team and should demonstrate charisma and enthusiasm in order to make the 17th of June a spectacular night. Previous experience in hospitality or May Balls, whilst beneficial, is not essential.</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity to be a part of one of the most exciting events of the year whilst earning some money.</p>
        <p>Please apply <b>before Thursday 14th February</b> for first consideration. Interviews will be held on February 16th and 17th, and 18th.</p>
        <p>If you wish to apply, please complete our online application form below. Please feel free to email us for more information at <a href="mailto:staffing@jesusmayball.com">staffing@jesusmayball.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Team Leader - &pound;100*</h2>
        <p>Team Leaders will oversee all the workers for one section of the Ball, (e.g. the food or on-call team). They are responsible for ensuring that everybody working on their team is confident in what they are doing and all work is completed to a satisfactory standard. In addition, Team Leaders are responsible for signing their team in and out at the start and end of the Ball.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a high attention to detail</li>
            <li>Can work well under pressure</li>
            <li>Can use their initiative</li>

            <li>Can motivate and manage a team</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previous leadership experience is essential for this role. Team Leaders will also receive 'right to buy' tickets to the next Jesus May Ball.</p>

        <hr><img src="../assets/light.png" id="nav-underline"></img>

        <h2>Court Supervisor - &pound;90*</h2>
        <p>Court Supervisors are responsible for ensuring everything operates smoothly in their designated court or area. This involves communicating with Team Leaders and relevant members of the committee when any issues arise or extra staffing is required. Court Supervisors are also responsible for signing in and out workers at the beginning and end of their breaks.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can work well under pressure</li>
            <li>Can use their initiative</li>
            <li>Have excellent communication skills</li>
            <li>Can motivate and manage a team</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Food and Drinks Worker - &pound;80*</h2>
        <p>Food and drink workers will be rotated through a variety of positions throughout the night. The positions mainly involve preparing and serving food and drink, as well as ensuring food and drink stalls are well stocked.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are friendly</li>
            <li>Can be professional when interacting with guests</li>
            <li>Can adapt quickly to new tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previous experience in hospitality or catering is certainly helpful.</p>

        <hr><img src="../assets/light.png" id="nav-underline"></img>

        <h2>Security Steward - &pound;80*</h2>
        <p>Security stewards are responsible for reporting anyone attempting to enter the Ball without a valid ticket; however, at no point will they be expected to directly confront or remove any unauthorised persons themselves. Security stewards are also responsible for the health and safety of guests, which involves fire stewarding and reporting any guests that behave in an inappropriate or dangerous manner.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are attentive and hard-working</li>
            <li>Can be professional when interacting with guests</li>
        </ul>

        <hr><img src="../assets/light.png" id="nav-underline"></img>

        <h2>Ents Runner - &pound;80*</h2>
        <p>The role of the ents runners is to escort acts to the correct stage at the correct time, and to help ensure that the entertainment schedule for the night runs smoothly.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show good timekeeping and organisational skills</li>
            <li>Can stay calm under pressure</li>
            <li>Are friendly and personable</li>
        </ul>

        <hr><img src="../assets/light.png" id="nav-underline"></img>

        <h2>On-Call Team - &pound;80*</h2>
        <p>Workers on the on-call team will be allocated different responsibilities throughout the night, depending on where staffing is needed. The role may involve stepping in where certain teams or areas are understaffed. This is perhaps one of the most interesting roles due to its varied nature, but also requires a cool head and an ability to adapt. Please note that this is a 'General Worker' role where you will have a timetable and are allocated different roles on the night, rather than 'Hit Squad'.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can work well under pressure</li>
            <li>Can use their initiative</li>
            <li>Can take on a variety of tasks</li>
            <li>Can respond quickly to instructions</li>

        <p>The litter collection team collect rubbish throughout the night and ensure it is disposed of appropriately. Workers will be rotated to different areas throughout the night in order to ensure they can experience as much of the ball as possible. This role is essential to ensure the Ball is kept clean for guests and to minimise clear-up required after the Ball has finished.</p>
        <p>We are looking for people who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be professional when working around guests</li>
            <li>Are attentive and hard-working</li>
        </ul>
