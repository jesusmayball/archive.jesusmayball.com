        <p class="charity-description">
            CAMFED envisions a world in which every child is educated, protected, respected and
            valued,
            and grows up to turn the tide of poverty. As the most effective strategy to tackle
            poverty
            and inequality, CAMFED multiplies educational opportunities for girls and empowers young
            women to become leaders of change. Our focus is on girls and young women in rural areas
            of
            sub-Saharan Africa. This is where girls face acute disadvantage and where their
            empowerment
            will have a transformative impact.
