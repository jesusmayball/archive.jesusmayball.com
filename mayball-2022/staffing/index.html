    <div id="staffing-information">
        <p>Jesus College May Ball (2022) is looking for committed and passionate individuals to work and help make this year's Ball a night to remember !!</p>
        <p>There are a variety of roles available, whether it be working as an Entertainment Runner, Security
            Steward or on Food and Drinks, there is certainly a role for you!! If leadership is your calling then why
            not apply for the more demanding and rewarding roles of Team Leader or Court Supervisor.</p>
        <p>Unlike some other Balls, Jesus does not operate under a 'half-on, half off' employment policy. All
            workers must work the whole ball, and are offered a competitive rate for this.</b></p>
        <p>We aim for our applicants to willingly work as part of a team, demonstrating a readiness to embrace
            their tasks and immerse themselves within the Ball's atmosphere. An army of charming workers will
            help make the 20th of June an exceptional night. Prior May Ball or hospitality experience is valuable,
            but not necessary.</p>
        <p>This is a night to remember and a fabulous opportunity to gain experience and to earn money whilst
            working at one of Cambridge's most anticipated and contested events of the year !!</p>
        <p>If this is for you, please apply before January 20th, when applications close, for first consideration.
            Interviews will take place on February 11th, 12th and 13th.</p>
