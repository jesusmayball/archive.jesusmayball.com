<h1>Readme for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog3.0</a></h1>
<h2>Errors and warnings</h2>

This page lists all the errors and warnings which analog can produce, together
with a short explanation.

<p>
First, you should understand the difference between a crash, an error, a
warning, and a debugging message. First, a <i>crash</i> is when analog exits
prematurely, without producing the whole output file. The system might give a
message, but analog will not give one of its own messages. Analog should never
crash. If it does crash, please <a href="bugs.html">tell me about it</a>.

<p>
An <i>error</i> is something which stops analog finishing its job. Whenever
an error is detected, analog gives a message starting something like
<kbd>analog: Fatal error:</kbd> and will then tell you what type of thing went
wrong before quitting.

<p>
A <i>warning</i> is a problem which is not fatal to analog: it will keep on
with its processing. These vary from the possibly serious, such as files which
could not be found, to purely informational. They produce a message starting
<kbd>analog: Warning</kbd>. You can turn warnings off using the
<kbd><a href="debug.html">WARNINGS</a></kbd> command.

<p>
Finally, a <i>debugging message</i> gives information on the state of the
program. They just begin with a single code letter followed by a colon. You
don't get any debugging messages unless you've <a href="debug.html">asked for
them</a>.

<p>
Now I shall describe all the possible <a href="#errs">errors</a> and
<a href="#warns">warnings</a> in detail.
<hr>
<h3><a name="errs">Errors</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Ran out of memory: cannot continue</b>
  <dd>Analog ran out of memory. Try increasing the memory available to the
      process, if your operating system will allow it, or using the
      <kbd><a href="lowmem.html">LOWMEM</a></kbd> commands.
  <dt><b>Cannot ignore mandatory configuration file</b>
  <dd>See the section in the Readme on the <a href="syntax.html">mandatory
      configuration file</a>.
  <dt><b>Can't find language file
      <br>Language file too short
      <br>Language file contains excessively long lines</b>
  <dd>Analog can't run without a well-formed language file. See the
      documentation on <a href="output.html">language files</a>.
  <dt><b>Attempted to read more than 50 configuration files</b>
  <dd>The most likely explanation for this is that you have accidentally
      created a loop using the
      <kbd><a href="syntax.html">CONFIGFILE</a></kbd> command.
  <dt><b>Incorrect default given in <kbd>analhead.h</kbd>
      <br>Default given in <kbd>analhead.h</kbd> too short</b>
  <dd>If you've compiled your own version, and you've specified an incorrect
      configuration in the file <kbd>analhead.h</kbd>, analog gives up to
      allow you to fix it.
  <dt><b>Failed to open output file for writing</b>
  <dd>Analog couldn't create, or couldn't write to, the output file you
      specified.
  <dt><b><kbd>OUTPUT NONE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE none</kbd> selected</b>
  <dd>You requested no output.
</dl>
<hr>
<h3><a name="warns">Warnings</a></h3>
Remember that warnings are not fatal, and that you can turn them off using the
<kbd><a href="debug.html">WARNINGS</a></kbd> command. The possible warnings
come in several different categories, shown by a letter in the warning
message. The categories are as follows.
<p>
<h4>Category C</h4>
This category indicates an incorrect configuration. Analog will either ignore
what you said, or try and do the best it can with it. There are too many
warnings in this category to list completely. You will have to consult the
documentation for the particular <a href="custom.html">configuration
command</a> that gave an error. If you get an error for a command which used
to work in a previous version of analog, have a look in the section
<cite><a href="update.html">Updating from older versions</a></cite>.
<p>
<h4>Category D</h4>
This is for configurations which might be intended, but which look suspicious.
<dl>
  <dt><b>Offset not a multiple of 30
      <br>Offset more than 25 hours</b>
  <dd>The <a href="logfile.html">time offsets</a> are meant to be for
      correcting between differences in time zones. These differences are
      usually multiples of 30 minutes between -25 and +25 hours. Maybe you
      specified the offset in hours instead of minutes by mistake, or
      something like that.
  <dt><b><kbd>SORTBY</kbd> doesn't match <kbd>FLOOR</kbd>
      <br><kbd>SORTBY</kbd> (or <kbd>FLOOR</kbd>) isn't included in
      <kbd>COLS</kbd></b>
  <dd>Within one report, it's helpful to your readers to have the sort method
      and the floor compatible, and both included in the <kbd>COLS</kbd>.
      (See the section on <cite><a href="othreps.html">Non-time
      reports</a></cite>).
  <dt><b>Time reports have not all got same value of <kbd>BACK</kbd></b>
  <dd>It's usually helpful to have all the <a href="timereps.html">time
      reports</a> running in the same direction.
  <dt><b>Report contains no <kbd>COLS</kbd></b>
  <dd>You've got an empty <kbd>COLS</kbd> list for one report, so you'll just
      get a list of names, not any information about them.
  <dt><b><kbd>LOWMEM 3</kbd> prevents that item being cached</b>
  <dd>You're making a <a href="cache.html">cache file</a>, but one item is
      not being recorded because of a
      <kbd><a href="lowmem.html">LOWMEM</a></kbd> command, and will therefore
      not be saved in the cache file.
  <dt><b><kbd>OUTFILE</kbd> and <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> are the same</b>
  <dd>The regular output will overwrite, or possibly be appended to, the
      cache file.
</dl>
<p>
<h4>Category F</h4>
This category is for diagnosing files which couldn't be opened or read
successfully. These can be serious, but the messages should be
self-explanatory.
<p>
<h4>Category L</h4>
When analog finishes reading a logfile, it checks whether there might have
been something wrong with it.
<dl>
  <dt><b>Large number of corrupt lines</b>
  <dd>This could indicate a problem with the logfile, or with the
      <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> specification. If you
      have a WebSTAR, Netscape or extended logfile, it might be missing the
      mandatory header line.
  <dt><b>Logfiles overlap: possible double counting</b>
  <dd>Two logfiles which were counting the same thing overlapped in
      time. Maybe you read two copies of the same logfile. Or maybe the
      <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> specification should
      have told analog to ignore some of the items.
</dl>
<p>
<h4>Category M</h4>
This category is for warnings about logfile formats which might make analog
produce unexpected results.
<dl>
  <dt><b>Logfile contains lines with no [whatevers], which are being
      filtered</b>
  <dd>This is usually harmless. It is perhaps best explained by
      example. Suppose you are <a href="include.html">excluding</a> certain
      files from the analysis, but that you are also analysing a browser log
      which just contains information about the browsers used, not which files
      they read. Then we can't exclude the browsers which read the excluded
      files, because we don't know which they were, so all browsers will be
      included.
  <dt><b>Logfile contains lines with no file names (or bytes): page (or byte)
      counts may be low</b>
  <dd>If a logfile line doesn't contain a file name, analog will assume that
      the request wasn't for a page. Similarly, if it doesn't give the number
      of bytes transferred, analog will make the bytes zero. So the number of
      page requests or bytes credited to the other items on that line will
      then be too low.
</dl>
<p>
<h4>Category R</h4>
This is used when analog turns off an empty report. This could be because none
of the relevant items were included in any of the logfiles, or perhaps
beacause a <kbd><a href="lowmem.html">LOWMEM</a></kbd> command stopped them
being recorded.
<h4>Broken Pipe</h4>
This is not an analog-generated warning, but it can result from analog closing
an logfile it's uncompressing without reading the whole of it, when it
determines that it will not need it.
