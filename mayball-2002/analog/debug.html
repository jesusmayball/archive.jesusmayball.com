<h2>Debugging</h2>

This section lists commands to help you debug analog, if you think it's
going wrong. There's another section later which lists all the
<a href="errors.html">errors and warnings</a> which analog can generate,
and what they all mean, and another section which tells you
<a href="bugs.html">how to report bugs</a>.

<p>
First, remember the option we mentioned before, to list the current settings
of all of analog's variables. To get this, just put <kbd>-settings</kbd> on
the command line, or <kbd>PRINTVARS ON</kbd> in one of your configuration
files, along with your other commands. Then analog will produce the list of
settings instead of running in the normal way.

<hr>
There are commands which control how much debugging information and warning
information analog gives out while it is running. By default you get all the
warnings and no debugging, but you can change this by means of the commands
<kbd>DEBUG</kbd> and <kbd>WARNINGS</kbd>. If you say
<pre>
DEBUG ON
</pre>
you get all the debugging. (And <kbd>DEBUG OFF</kbd> turns it off again.)
You can also get just certain categories of debugging. The categories are
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>list all corrupt logfile lines
  <dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>information about DNS lookups
  <dt><kbd>F</kbd><dd>information about file opening and closing
  <dt><kbd>S</kbd><dd>summary information about each logfile when it's closed
  <dt><kbd>U</kbd><dd>list unknown domains
</dl>
So, for example, the command
<pre>
DEBUG FS
</pre>
would give you information about file opening and closing, and what was in
each logfile, but none of the other sorts of debugging. Each line of debugging
information is prepended with its code letter. You can also specify
<pre>
DEBUG +CD
</pre>
to add <kbd>C</kbd>- and <kbd>D</kbd>-category debugging, and
<pre>
DEBUG -CD
</pre>
to remove them.
<p>
The <kbd>WARNINGS</kbd> command acts similarly. As well as <kbd>WARNINGS
ON</kbd> and <kbd>WARNINGS OFF</kbd>, there are warnings in the following
categories.
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd>invalid configuration specified
  <dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>dubious configuration specified
  <dt><kbd>F</kbd><dd>files missing
  <dt><kbd>L</kbd><dd>apparent problems in logfiles
  <dt><kbd>M</kbd><dd>possibly problems in logfiles
  <dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd>turning off empty reports
</dl>
See the section on <a href="errors.html">errors and warnings</a> for more
details about these various categories. Again, warnings are printed with
their code letters.
<p>
You can also use command line abbreviations for these commands. The
<kbd>DEBUG</kbd> command is represented by <kbd>+V</kbd> (for <kbd>ON</kbd>),
<kbd>-V</kbd> (for <kbd>OFF</kbd>), <kbd>+VFS</kbd> (to select options
<kbd>FS</kbd>), <kbd>+V+FS</kbd> (to add those options), and <kbd>+V-FS</kbd>
(to remove them). Similarly the <kbd>WARNINGS</kbd> command can be given by
<kbd>+q</kbd>, <kbd>-q</kbd>, <kbd>+q&lt;options&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>+q+&lt;options&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>+q-&lt;options&gt;</kbd>.
<hr>
There is one more command which is useful when trying to debug analog. If
you give the command
<pre>
PROGRESSFREQ 20000  # say
</pre>
then analog will produce a little message after every 20,000 lines it reads
from the logfile. This is useful to determine whether the program has really
stopped or (as is more likely) is just being slow for some reason (such as
using DNS lookups).
<p>
There is just one more section about analog's configuration commands and
command line arguments, but it's a rather long one, on the
<a href="form.html">form interface</a>. (This is a way of running analog by
selecting options from a web page.) You might prefer to go straight onto the
section on <cite><a href="meaning.html">What the results mean</a></cite>.
