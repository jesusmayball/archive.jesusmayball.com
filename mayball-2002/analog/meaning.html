<h2>What the results mean</h2>

This section of the Readme is about understanding the results analog
produces. It's divided into two subsections.

<ul>
  <li><cite><a href="webworks.html">How the web works</a></cite>. This section
      discusses what happens when somebody connects to your web site, and what
      you can and can't find out about them. If you think that you can get
      statistics on how many people have visited your web site (or want to
      know why you can't), then this section is for you.
  <li><cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's definitions</a></cite>. This section
      gives precise details on what is included in each report, what analog
      counts as a successful request, and so on.
</ul>
