<h2>How the web works</h2>

This page is about what happens when somebody connects to your web site, and
what statistics you can and can't calculate. There is a lot of confusion
about this. It's not helped by statistics programs which claim to calculate
things which cannot really be calculated, only estimated, with varying degrees
of accuracy. The simple fact is that certain data which we are used to knowing
for traditional print and even broadcast media are simply not available on the
web.

<p>
I should say that these ideas
are not new to me. In particular, I can recommend four excellent articles
about this subject:

<b>1. The basic model.</b> Let's suppose I visit your web site. I follow a
link from somewhere else to your front page, read some pages, and then follow
one of your links out of your site.
<p>
So, what do you know about it? First, I make one request for your front
page. You know the date and time of the request and which page I asked for
(of course), and the internet address of my computer (my <i>host</i>). I also
usually tell you which page referred me to your site, and the make and model
of my browser. I do not tell you my user name or my e-mail address.
<p>
Next, I look at the page (or rather my browser does) to see if it's got any
graphics on it. If so, and if I've got image loading turned on in my browser,
I make a separate connection to retrieve each of these graphics. I never log
into your site: I just make a sequence of requests, one for each new file I
want to download. The referring page for each of these graphics is your front
page. Maybe there are 10 graphics on your front page. Then so far I've made 11
requests to your server.
<p>
After that, I go and visit some of your other pages, making a new request for
each page and graphic that I want. Finally, I follow a link out of your site.
You never know about that at all. I just connect to the next site without
telling you.

<hr>
<b>2. Caches.</b> It's not always quite as simple as that. One major problem
is cacheing. There are two major types of cacheing. First, my browser
automatically caches files when I download them. This means that if I visit
them again, the next day say, I don't need to download the whole page
again. Depending on the settings on my browser, I might check with you that
the page hasn't changed: in that case, you do know about it, and analog will
count it as a new request for the page. But I might set my browser not to
check with you: then I will read the page again without you ever knowing about
it.
<p>
The other sort of cache is on a larger scale. I'm in the UK. Because the link
across the Atlantic is sometimes very congested, we've set up a national
cache. (Many individual ISP's also do the same thing.) I can set my browser to
get your pages from the national cache instead of directly from you. If anyone
else in the country has used the cache to look at your pages recently, the
cache will have saved them, and will give them out to me without ever telling
you about it. So hundreds of people could read your pages, even though you'd
only sent it out once. Also, if the page I wanted wasn't already stored in the
cache, the cache would ask for it from you on my behalf. This would mean that
the request appeared to come from the cache, rather than from me. If several
people did this, you would think that only one host was accessing the cache,
rather than lots of different ones.

<hr>
<b>3. What you can know.</b> The only things you can know for certain are the
number of requests made to your server, when they were made, which files were
asked for, and which host asked you for them.
<p>
You can also know what people told you their browsers were, and what the
referring pages were. You should be aware, though, that many browsers lie
deliberately about what sort of browser they are, or even let users configure
the browser name. Also, some browsers send incorrect referrers, telling you
the last page that the user was on even if they weren't referred by that page.

<hr>
<b>4. What you can't know.</b>
<ol type=i>
  <li><i>You can't tell the identity of your readers</i>.
      Unless you explicitly require users to provide a password, you don't
      know who's connected or what their e-mail addresses are.
  <li><i>You can't tell how many visitors you've had</i>.
      You can guess by looking at the number of distinct hosts that have
      requested things from you. But this is not always a good estimate for
      three reasons. First, if users get your pages from a local cache server,
      you will never know about it. Secondly, sometimes many users connect
      from the same host: either users from the same company or ISP, or users
      using the same cache server. Finally, sometimes one user connects from
      many different hosts. In most countries, 'phone calls are not free. So
      users sometimes download one page, disconnect from their ISP, and then
      reconnect to follow a link: but when they reconnect, they will often be
      allocated a different hostname by their ISP. The same can happen if users
      access the web from their company through a firewall.
  <li><i>You can't tell how many visits you've had</i>.
      Many programs, under pressure from advertisers' organisations, define a
      &quot;visit&quot; (or &quot;session&quot;) as a sequence of requests
      from the same host until there is a half-hour gap. This is an unsound
      method for several reasons. First, it assumes that each host corresponds
      to a separate person and vice versa. This is simply not true in the real
      world, as discussed in the last paragraph. Secondly, it assumes that
      there is never a half-hour gap in a genuine visit. This is also untrue.
      I quite often follow a link out of a site, then step back in my browser
      and continue with the first site from where I left off. Should it really
      matter whether I do this 29 or 31 minutes later? Finally, to make the
      computation tractable, such programs also need to assume that your
      logfile is in chronological order: it isn't always, and analog will
      produce the same results however you jumble the lines up.
  <li><i>You can't follow a person's path through your site</i>.
      Even if you assume that each person corresponds one-to-one to a host,
      you don't know their path through your site. It's very common for people
      to go back to pages they've downloaded before. You never know about
      these subsequent visits to that page, because their browser has cached
      them. So you can't track their path through your site accurately.
  <li><i>You often can't tell where they entered your site, or where they
      found out about you from</i>.
      If they are using a cache server, they will often be able to retrieve
      your home page from their cache, but not all of the subsequent pages
      they want to read. Then the first page you know about them requesting
      will be one in the middle of their true visit.
  <li><i>You can't tell how they left your site, or where they went next</i>.
      They never tell you about their connection to another site, so there's no
      way for your to know about it.
  <li><i>You can't tell how long people spent reading each page</i>.
      The same comments apply as in the previous paragraph. You can't tell
      which pages they are reading between successive requests for pages. They
      might be reading some pages they downloaded earlier. They might have
      followed a link out of your site, and they might or might not return
      later. They might have interrupted their reading for a quick game of
      Minesweeper. You just don't know.
</ol>
The bottom line is that HTTP is a stateless protocol. People don't log in
and retrieve several documents: they make a separate connection for each
file they want. And a lot of the time they don't even behave as if they
were logged into one site. Hence analog's emphasis on requests, rather
than visits.
<hr>
I've presented a somewhat negative view on this page, emphasising what you
can't find out. Web statistics are still informative: it's just important not
to slip from &quot;this page has received 30,000 requests&quot; to
&quot;30,000 people have read this page.&quot; In the
<a href="defns.html">next section</a>, I'll tell you exactly how analog
defines its terms, and what counts in each category.
