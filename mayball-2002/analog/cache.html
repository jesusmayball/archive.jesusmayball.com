<h2>Cache files</h2>

Analog has the ability to archive <strong>some</strong> of the data in your
logfile into a <i>cache file</i> so that the logfile can be thrown away
without losing the most important data.

<p>
For most people, the cache file will not be needed: compressing
the logfile using a standard compression utility such as gzip will be
sufficient. Compressing a logfile is very efficient owing to the large number
of repeated strings: I find about 12 times compression in practice. That in
itself may solve your filespace problems, without needing to throw away any
information.

<p>
If you are going to use the cache file feature, it is very important that you
understand what is and what is not recorded. It is <strong>not</strong>
possible to reconstruct everything of interest in the logfile from the cache
file. The cache file does contain information about the total number of
requests for each host and each file, but not about, for example, which files
were read by which hosts. (To do so would take up as much disk space as the
compressed logfile.) So you cannot later look at only one file and see which
hosts read that file. Similarly, you cannot later restrict the files or hosts
by date, using <kbd>FROM</kbd> and <kbd>TO</kbd> commands.
<p>
In summary, you should do all the inclusions and exclusions you want when you
create the logfile. If you want different sets of inclusions and exclusions,
you should create several cache files from the same logfile. You cannot later
apply extra inclusions and exclusions accurately.
<p>
One other minor point: the pattern of failed requests and redirected requests
over time is not recorded in the cache file. So although the total number will
still be correct, the number in the last 7 days can be under-reported
subsequently.

<hr>
You can create a cache file by setting the <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> to be
the file you want the cache to live in. Set
<pre>
CACHEOUTFILE none
</pre>
to turn it off again. You will still get the regular output as well as the
cache output, unless you request <kbd><a href="output.html">OUTPUT
NONE</a></kbd>.

<p>
You can read in a previously-made cache file with the <kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd>
command, or with the <kbd>+U</kbd> command line option. As with the
<kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFILE</a></kbd> command, you can use commas
and wild cards to read in several cache files, and read compressed cache
files using the <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> mechanism. Note that if you don't
want to read a logfile as well as the cache file, you will have to explicitly
set the <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> to <kbd>none</kbd>.
<p>
When analog reads in a cache file, it will respect inclusions and exclusions
as far as it can, but it does not apply any more aliases to the items. (This
is to avoid double-aliasing.) So you must do any aliases you want at the time
you create the cache file. Similarly, it does not obey the
<kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGOFFSET</a></kbd> variable, to avoid
double-offsetting, so any offset you want must be applied at cache-creation
time too.
<p>
Sometimes you don't want to record all the types of item in the cache file.
You might want to forget about which hosts had accessed your web site, for
example, and only remember how many times each file was requested. You can
choose not to include one type of item in the cache file by setting its
<kbd><a href="lowmem.html">LOWMEM</a></kbd> to 3; for example, specify
<pre>
HOSTLOWMEM 3
</pre>
to exclude hosts from the cache file. Because this is a serious
step, analog will produce a warning if you do this. You can even set all six
<kbd>LOWMEM</kbd>s to 3 if you just want to remember the pattern of requests
over time, not even which files were requested.
<p>
It is legal to have the <kbd>CACHEOUTFILE</kbd> the same as the
<kbd>CACHEFILE</kbd> to overwrite the old cache file with an updated one,
but it is not recommended. It is best to make a separate cache file for
each logfile. Failing that, it is better to write the new cache to a
different file, and only delete the old cache when you have verified that
the new cache was created correctly.

<hr>
To use this feature and avoid losing entries or double counting them, I
suggest you follow the following procedure.
<ol>
  <li>Archive the old logfile, and restart the server with a fresh logfile.
      (See your server documentation for how to do this.)
  <li>Make both a cache file and an ordinary report from the old logfile.
  <li>Make a report from the cache file and compare it against the report from
      the logfile to check it works.
</ol>
Now you can throw away the old logfile, if you've really understood what
data you're losing by doing so. (But please remember that I can take no
responsibility if something goes wrong. (See the
<a href="Licence.txt">licence</a>.)
<p>
I prefer to make a separate cache file from each logfile, in case something
goes wrong with one of them, rather than a single cache file combining several
logfiles, or a single cache file combining an old cache file and a logfile.
