<h2>Choosing a logfile</h2>

This is a rather long page, so here is a quick summary of the most important
points:
<ul>
  <li>You choose which logfile to analyse by the <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command.
  <li>Analog will attempt to detect which format your logfile is in, based on
      the first line.
  <li>If your logfile is not in one of the formats analog knows about, or if
      analog can't tell reliably which format it's in, or if it has lines in
      different formats, or if its first line is corrupt, you can tell analog
      what format the file is in.
  <li>Analog can uncompress compressed logfiles.
  <li>At the end of this page, there's a <a href="#formats">description of all
      the log formats</a> analog knows about.
</ul>

<hr>
The basic command for selecting a logfile is
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename
</pre>
or just to put the logfile name on the command line without any arguments,
e.g., <kbd>analog logfilename</kbd>. A <kbd>-</kbd> sign or the word
<kbd>stdin</kbd> is interpreted as standard input: this is useful on Unix
systems for constructing pipes. The word <kbd>none</kbd> means that the
list of logfiles specified so far is erased. All logfiles must be on your
local disk -- analog doesn't fetch them from across the network.
In the Mac version, you can also analyse a particular single logfile by
dragging it onto the analog icon.

<p>
You can have several <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> commands. You can include wildcards in
the logfile name (but not necessarily in the directory name: this is
system-dependent), and you can use a list of logfiles separated by commas
(without spaces). So the following commands would tell analog to read
<kbd>logfile1</kbd>, <kbd>c:\logs\logfile2</kbd>, and all files ending in
<kbd>.log</kbd>:
<pre>
LOGFILE logfile1,*.log
LOGFILE c:\logs\logfile2
</pre>
The <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> commands are cumulative, except that any logfiles
on the command line or in user-specified configuration files override any
in the default configuration file, and are themselves overridden by any in
the mandatory configuration file.

<hr>
Analog knows about several different types of logfile. By default it will
attempt to see if your logfile is of one of the types it knows about, based
on the first line. (<strong>Note</strong>: if the first line of your logfile
is corrupt, or if your logfile has lines in different formats, you'll have to
tell analog the logfile type yourself). The types it can diagnose are the
common log format, the NCSA combined format, referrer log and browser log, the
W3 extended log format, the Microsoft IIS format (sometimes), the Netscape
format, the WebSTAR format, and the Netpresenz format (sometimes).
<a href="#formats">Examples of all these formats</a> are given at the end of
this page. If you have <a href="debug.html">debugging</a> on, analog will
report what type of logfile it thinks yours is.

<p>
The reason for the &quot;sometimes&quot; in the previous paragraph is as
follows. The Microsoft and Netpresenz formats are extremely badly designed in
that the date can occur in either of the forms date/month/year or
month/date/year, and they don't say which they're using. Analog will detect
them automatically if it can tell which date format is being used (e.g.,
13/2/98 or 2/13/98), but if it can't, it will tell you to use one of the
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> strings below. Also, the NCSA browser log can only be
detected if it includes the date.

<hr>
You can also specify a different type of logfile, using the
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> or <kbd>DEFAULTLOGFORMAT</kbd> command. If all your
logfiles are of formats that analog can diagnose, you need never use the these
commands.

<p>
When you start up analog, all logfiles have the <i>default logfile format</i>.
This is normally automatic detection, as explained above, but you can change
it if your logfiles are always in a format which analog doesn't know about.
You do this by means of the command
<pre>
DEFAULTLOGFORMAT format
</pre>
-- we'll discuss what the formats can be in a minute.

<p>
Sometimes you might want to analyse several logfiles with different formats.
For this you need the <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command. This command only applies
to future logfiles in the same configuration file. So if you change the format
with a command like
<pre>
LOGFORMAT format
</pre>
then any logfiles you select with a <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command <em>later</em>
in the same configuration file will get the new format.

<p>
The possible formats for use with the <kbd>DEFAULTLOGFORMAT</kbd> and
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands are of two types. First there are some symbolic
words, and then there are <i>log format strings</i>. We'll look at the words
first.

<p>
There are format words for all the built-in formats analog knows about.
For example, <kbd>COMMON</kbd> will select common format; you can also have
<kbd>COMBINED</kbd>, <kbd>REFERRER</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSER</kbd>,
<kbd>EXTENDED</kbd>, <kbd>MICROSOFT-NA</kbd> (North American date format),
<kbd>MICROSOFT-INT</kbd> (international date format),
<kbd>NETSCAPE</kbd>, <kbd>WEBSTAR</kbd>, <kbd>NETPRESENZ-NA</kbd> (North
American) or <kbd>NETPRESENZ-INT</kbd> (international). There are also the
words <kbd>AUTO</kbd> for automatic detection and <kbd>DEFAULT</kbd> for
whatever the default log format is.

<p>
If your logfile is not in one of the recognised formats, you can tell analog
about your format using a log format string. You only ever need this if your
logfile has lines which are not in one of the standard formats. The format
string consists of a template for the logfile line, with the various fields
and special characters replaced by codes as follows.
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>%S</kbd><dd>host (computer making the request)
  <dt><kbd>%r</kbd><dd>file requested
  <dt><kbd>%R</kbd><dd>Mac-style filename, with colons instead of slashes
  <dt><kbd>%B</kbd><dd>browser
  <dt><kbd>%f</kbd><dd>referrer (URL referring to the file)
  <dt><kbd>%u</kbd><dd>user (tip: a cookie can usefully be defined as
      <kbd>%u</kbd> too)
  <dt><kbd>%v</kbd><dd>virtual host
  <dt><kbd>%d</kbd><dd>day of the month
  <dt><kbd>%m</kbd><dd>month in digits
  <dt><kbd>%M</kbd><dd>month, three letter abbreviation
  <dt><kbd>%y</kbd><dd>year, last two digits
  <dt><kbd>%Y</kbd><dd>year, four digits
  <dt><kbd>%h</kbd><dd>hour of the day
  <dt><kbd>%n</kbd><dd>minute of the hour
  <dt><kbd>%a</kbd><dd><kbd>a</kbd> for am or <kbd>p</kbd> for pm
      (if <kbd>%h</kbd> is 12-hour clock)
  <dt><kbd>%b</kbd><dd>number of bytes transferred
  <dt><kbd>%c</kbd><dd>HTTP status code
  <dt><kbd>%C</kbd><dd>Special code, specific to particular servers
  <dt><kbd>%q</kbd><dd>query string (part of filename after <kbd>?</kbd>, if
      recorded in a separate field)
  <dt><kbd>%j</kbd><dd>junk: ignore this field
  <dt><kbd>%w</kbd><dd>white space: spaces or tabs
  <dt><kbd>%W</kbd><dd>optional white space
  <dt><kbd>%%</kbd><dd><kbd>%</kbd> sign
  <dt><kbd>\n</kbd><dd>new line
  <dt><kbd>\t</kbd><dd>tab stop
  <dt><kbd>\\</kbd><dd>single backslash
</dl>
(I shall refer to the first seven things above as <i>items</i>.)
So for example, the common log format, which looks like
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [14/Mar/1996:17:45:35 +0000] "GET /~sret1/ HTTP/1.0" 200 1243
</pre>
can be represented by the <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%S - %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r %j" %c %b)
</pre>
including two items, host and file. (The parentheses are needed because the
argument contains spaces.)
<p>
Logfiles often contain lines in several different formats, so you can specify
several log formats one after the other and they will accumulate. For example, the definition of common format
should also include the line
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%S - %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r" %c %b)
</pre>
to handle lines where the <kbd>HTTP/1.0</kbd> part of the request is
absent. Or you might use
<pre>
LOGFORMAT COMMON
LOGFORMAT COMBINED
</pre>
to represent a logfile which had lines in both those formats.
Analog tries to match the line to the first format first, then if that
fails the next, and so on, so the order of the formats is important. Usually
you want to specify the most common one first, to minimise the time spent
trying to match lines to inappropriate formats.

<p>
The log formats which analog can handle are those which are known as
<i>instantaneously decipherable</i>: this means that the character
which terminates a string can never occur in the string. In the above example,
if the hostname ever contained a space, the line would be marked as corrupt,
because analog terminates the host at the first space, not at the first
occurrence of space-dash-space, and then the rest of the line wouldn't match.
Of course, hostnames should never contain spaces, so this shouldn't be a
problem. There are a couple of other restrictions: if there is any date or
time information, then the year, month, date, hour and minute must all be
present: and the same information may not occur twice in the format (so you
can't have both <kbd>%m</kbd> and <kbd>%M</kbd>, for example).

<p>
Sometimes you need to read one of the fields in a logfile, but not analyse it.
For example, if you have a separate common log and referrer log, the referrer
log might look like
<pre>
[14/Mar/1996:17:48:10] http://guide-p.infoseek.com/Titles -> /~sret1/analog/
</pre>
But the requests for <kbd>/~sret1/analog/</kbd> would already have been
counted when reading the main logfile, so you don't want to count them again
now. You get round this by specifying a <kbd>*</kbd> in that item in the
format string, like this:
<pre>
LOGFORMAT ([%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] %f -> %*r)
</pre>
Any of the seven items can be treated in this way.

<p>
Here are the exact rules about which logfile gets which log formats. The
default logfile format starts off at <kbd>AUTO</kbd>. You can change it with a
<kbd>DEFAULTLOGFORMAT</kbd> command, and then the default format accumulates
unless you specify <kbd>DEFAULTLOGFORMAT AUTO</kbd> to return to automatic
detection. 
<p>
The current logfile format starts off at <kbd>DEFAULT</kbd>. You can change
it with a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command, and then the current format accumulates
until a <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command intervenes; then it restarts at the next
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command. It also restarts if you specify
<kbd>LOGFORMAT AUTO</kbd> or <kbd>LOGFILE DEFAULT</kbd>; or when the current
format is reset to <kbd>DEFAULT</kbd> automatically, which happens at the end
of the command line, and of every configuration file, and whenever a
<kbd>LOGFILE none</kbd> command is encountered.
<p>
The default logfile selected at compilation time always gets the default
format (although exactly what the default format is can still be changed with
a <kbd>DEFAULTLOGFORMAT</kbd> command). Any logfile declared later, in a
configuration file for example, gets the current log format at the time it is
selected. If you specify several logfiles, they will all use
the same format, unless there's a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command or
an implicit return to <kbd>DEFAULT</kbd> format between them.

<hr>
There's also a second argument to the logfile command, which specifies a
prefix to add to all the filenames in that logfile. This is useful if
you've got several different servers or virtual hosts, when the same
filename may occur on each of the servers. The argument can contain a
<kbd>%v</kbd>, and the name of the virtual host will then be inserted at that
point. For example,
<pre>
LOGFILE log1,log2 http://www.%v.mydomain.com
</pre>
would translate a filename <kbd>/file.html</kbd> with virtual host
<kbd>spam</kbd> in <kbd>log1</kbd> or <kbd>log2</kbd> to
<kbd>http://www.spam.mydomain.com/file.html</kbd>. If you are using the second
argument to the <kbd>LOGFILE</kbd> command, you will probably want to use
the <kbd><a href="hierreps.html">SUBDIR</a></kbd> command as well.

<p>
If <kbd>%v</kbd> is included in the argument and the line doesn't have virtual
host, that line will be marked as corrupt. If
<kbd><a href="lowmem.html">VHOSTLOWMEM 3</a></kbd> is specified, the
<kbd>%v</kbd>'s will not be translated and will just appear as <kbd>%v</kbd>
in the output.

<hr>
There is one other command which applies to individual logfiles, in a similar
way to the <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd>. Sometimes your server is not (or believes it
is not) in the same timezone as you. So that you can give your statistics in
your local time, there is a command <kbd>LOGTIMEOFFSET</kbd> to change the time
by a certain number of minutes. You have to be careful using this. Because of
daylight savings time in operation in different parts of the world at
different times, analog cannot attempt to convert between different
timezones. So it's your responsibility to set the right offset for different
times of year. For example, if you were in Chicago, but your server was
recording time in GMT, you would need to specify two different time offsets,
one of minus five hours for summer and one of minus six hours for winter. You
would need to split your logfiles in the right places and then run commands
like
<pre>
LOGTIMEOFFSET -300
LOGFILE summer*.log
LOGTIMEOFFSET -360
LOGFILE winter*.log
</pre>

<p>
While we're on the subject of time offsets, there is one other similar
command, which is not directly to do with logfiles. You can specify a
<kbd>TIMEOFFSET</kbd> command to say how much analog should offset
the time of the computer on which it is running, to get your local time.

<hr>
It is often convenient to store logfiles compressed to save disk space.
Analog on the Mac can read logfiles compressed using gzip. And
analog on Unix, Win32, and VMS 7.0 and above can read compressed logfiles
provided that you use an <kbd>UNCOMPRESS</kbd> command to say how to
uncompress them. You need to supply the types of file that you want to
uncompress in a comma-separated list, together with the name of a command that
will uncompress the files to standard output (rather than to a file). For
example, on Unix you might use
<pre>
UNCOMPRESS *.gz,*.Z  /usr/bin/gzcat
</pre>
whereas on Windows NT, you might use
<pre>
UNCOMPRESS *.gz "c:\Program Files\gzip\gzip -cd"
</pre>
and on VMS, it could be
<pre>
UNCOMPRESS *.LOG-GZ;*  "gunzip -c"
</pre>

This would be a suitable command to include in the default configuration file.
<p>
If analog determines when it starts to uncompress a logfile that that file
isn't wanted for the analysis, two undesirable things can happen. Either the
program might pause until the logfile is fully uncompressed, or there might be
a &quot;broken pipe&quot; error reported. This is system dependent, and out
of analog's control.

<hr>
<h3><a name="formats">Appendix</a>: logfile formats</h3>

Here is a summary of the various logfile formats which analog knows about.

<p>
The common logfile format is written by most servers. Its lines look like
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [14/Mar/1996:17:45:35 +0000] "GET /~sret1/ HTTP/1.0" 200 1243
</pre>
Specifying <kbd>LOGFORMAT COMMON</kbd> is the same as specifying the three
commands
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r %j" %c %b)
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r" %c %b)
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j" %c %b)
</pre>

<hr width=50% align=left>
The NCSA referrer log looks like
<pre>
[14/Mar/1996:17:48:10] http://guide-p.infoseek.com/Titles -> /~sret1/analog/
</pre>
and the browser (or agent) log looks like
<pre>
[14/Mar/1996:17:45:08] Mozilla/2.0 (X11; I; HP-UX A.09.05 9000/735)
</pre>
The respective <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands are
<pre>
LOGFORMAT ([%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] %f -> %*r)
LOGFORMAT ([%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] %B)
</pre>
In both of these logfiles the date can be omitted, except if the date is
omitted in the browser log, analog will not be able to detect the log format
automatically. (It doesn't contain enough clues, so there is too much danger
of confusing other log formats with it; just use
&quot;<kbd>LOGFORMAT %B</kbd>&quot;).

<hr width=50% align=left>
The NCSA combined log is the same as the common log, except that
it has the referrer and browser on the end in quotes, like this:
<pre>
jay.bird.com - fred [14/Mar/1996:17:45:35 +0000] "GET /~sret1/ HTTP/1.0" 200 1243
"http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/" "Mozilla/2.0 (X11; I; HP-UX A.09.05 9000/735)"
</pre>
except all one line. If you are using the Apache server, you can generate this
with the <kbd>mod_log_config</kbd> module, using the command
<pre>
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\""
</pre>
The corresponding <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands are
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r %j" %c %b "%f" "%B")
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j %r" %c %b "%f" "%B")
LOGFORMAT (%S %j %u [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j" %c %b "%f" "%B")
</pre>
It is usually better to use the combined log than separate logs, because it
stores more information in less space.

<hr width=50% align=left>
The W3 extended log, the Netscape log, and the WebSTAR log can be recognised
because they <b>must</b> include at or near the top a line telling analog
what to expect on subsequent lines. Analog constructs a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd>
template based on this header line. (They may also contain later lines
changing the format).
<p>
The extended log is described at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html</a>.
Its header line looks like
<pre>
#Fields: date time cs-uri
</pre>
In the rest of the logfile, the fields can be separated by spaces or tabs. The
WebSTAR file has a header line like
<pre>
!!LOG_FORMAT DATE TIME RESULT URL BYTES_SENT HOSTNAME
</pre>
In the rest of the logfile, the fields are separated by tabs. Some other Mac
servers also use the WebSTAR format, or something looking like it. Analog will
understand these too. Finally, the Netscape header line looks like
<pre>
format=%Ses->client.ip% [%SYSDATE%] "%Req->reqpb.clf-request%"
%Req->srvhdrs.clf-status% %Req->srvhdrs.content-length%
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes these three logfile formats can contain header lines which refer
to the same item in two different ways. Analog doesn't know which one you
want to count, so such header lines will generate a &quot;corrupt format
line&quot; warning. You can then use a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command to
specify the format more precisely.
<hr width=50% align=left>
The Microsoft IIS logfile looks like
<pre>
192.64.25.41, -, 21/02/97, 00:03:46, W3SVC, SPIDER, 192.16.225.10,
30, 303, 1455, 200, 0, GET, /siege.htm, -,
</pre>
(except all on one line) or
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%S, %u, %d/%m/%y, %h:%n:%j, W3SVC, %j, %v, %j, %j, %b, %c, %j, %j, %r, %j,)
</pre>
However, the format is extremely badly designed, in that the date follows local
conventions: in other words, in North America the above example would have the
date <kbd>02/21/97</kbd> instead. Analog will diagnose which form the logfile
is in if possible: but if both the date and the month are at most 12, there
is no way to tell which format it is. In this case, you need to use the
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command <kbd>MICROSOFT-NA</kbd> for North American date
format, or <kbd>MICROSOFT-INT</kbd> for international date format. It may even
be that the date is in neither of these formats, in which case you need to use
a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> command of your own.
<p>
There are also various third-party extensions to the Microsoft format to
include, for example, the browser and referrer. Analog can't automatically
diagnose these: you need to write a <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> string for them.
<hr width=50% align=left>
The Netpresenz logfile is unusual in that each entry can spread over several
lines. It looks like
<pre>
5:54 pm  14/11/96  134.87.19.110  HTTP    get file  Research.html
Web:Research:Research.html
Referer: http://guide-p.infoseek.com/Titles
</pre>
The fields are separated by tabs. It is equivalent to four
<kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> commands:
<pre>
LOGFORMAT (%h:%n %aM\t%m/%d/%y\t%S\tHTTP\t\t%C\t%j\t\n%R\nReferer: %f)
LOGFORMAT (%h:%n %aM\t%m/%d/%y\t%S\tHTTP\t\t%C\t%j\t\n%R)
LOGFORMAT (%h:%n %aM\t%m/%d/%y\t%S\tHTTP\t\t%C\t%R)
LOGFORMAT (%j)
</pre>
Again, the Netpresenz format uses local conventions for the date and time.
Analog will diagnose it where it can: otherwise, you will have to use
<pre>
LOGFORMAT NETPRESENZ-NA    # dates like 9:14 AM  3/23/98 (upper case AM)
</pre>
or
<pre>
LOGFORMAT NETPRESENZ-INT   # dates like 9:14 am  23/3/98 (lower case am)
</pre>
Again, it can be that the date and time is in neither of these forms, in
which case you will have to enter your own <kbd>LOGFORMAT</kbd> string.
