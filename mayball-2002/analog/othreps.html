<h2>Other reports</h2>

This section deals with the non-time reports. There are quite a lot of
commands which control these reports, although we've seen some of them
already.

<p>
First, these reports have <kbd>COLS</kbd> commands, just like the time
reports. (See the section on <cite><a href="timereps.html">Time
reports</a></cite> for how to use these commands.) In the non-time reports,
one additional column is possible, namely <kbd>D</kbd> for date of last
access. So, for example,
<pre>
REQCOLS RD
</pre>
lists the number of requests for each file in the Request Report, and the
time when that file was last requested. The full list of <kbd>COLS</kbd>
commands for non-time reports is <kbd>HOSTCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>DOMCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>REQCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>DIRCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>TYPECOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>SIZECOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>FAILCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>REFCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REFSITECOLS</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>FULLBROWCOLS</kbd> (Browser Report),
<kbd>BROWCOLS</kbd> (Browser Summary), <kbd>VHOSTCOLS</kbd>,
<kbd>USERCOLS</kbd>, <kbd>FAILUSERCOLS</kbd> and <kbd>STATUSCOLS</kbd>. Not
every column is allowed in every report, but if you specify an illegal one,
analog will warn you about it.
<hr>
Next you need to know how use a <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> command to specify
how the reports should be sorted. There are six possible ways of sorting
reports: <kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>, <kbd>PAGES</kbd> (i.e., page requests),
<kbd>BYTES</kbd>, <kbd>DATE</kbd>, <kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd> and
<kbd>RANDOM</kbd> (no sorting, sometimes useful for speed in very long
reports). For example, the command
<pre>
HOSTSORTBY ALPHABETICAL
</pre>
will sort the Host Report alphabetically. The other <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> commands
are <kbd>DOMSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REQSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>DIRSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>TYPESORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>FAILSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>REFSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REFSITESORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>FULLBROWSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>BROWSORTBY</kbd>,
<kbd>VHOSTSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>USERSORTBY</kbd>, <kbd>FAILUSERSORTBY</kbd> and
<kbd>STATUSSORTBY</kbd>. Again, not every sort method is possible in every
report, but you'll be warned if you choose an illegal one.
<p>
There is one known bug concerned with <kbd>SORTBY ALPHABETICAL</kbd>. The
report is sorted before any <kbd><a href="alias.html">OUTPUTALIAS</a></kbd> is
applied. This means that if an <kbd>OUTPUTALIAS</kbd> has been specified for
the report, then the report will not be sorted correctly.
<hr>
You can also specify a <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> for most reports, saying how much
activity an item needs before it is listed on the report. There are lots
of possible ways of specifying floors, which I'll list here, using the
<kbd>DOMFLOOR</kbd> (Domain Report <kbd>FLOOR</kbd>) command as an example.
Essentially each one consists of a number indicating the level of the floor,
followed by a letter indicating the floor criterion.
<pre>
DOMFLOOR 1000r       # all domains with at least 1000 requests
DOMFLOOR 1000p       # at least 1000 requests for pages
DOMFLOOR 1000000b    # at least 1,000,000 bytes transferred
DOMFLOOR 1Mb         # at least 1 megabyte
DOMFLOOR 0.5%r       # 0.5% of the requests (ditto %p and %b)
DOMFLOOR 0.5:r       # 0.5% of the maximum number of requests
                     # for any domain (ditto :p and :b)
DOMFLOOR 970701d     # last access since 1st July 1997
DOMFLOOR -00-01-00d  # last access in last month (see
                     # doucumentation on FROM and TO commands)
DOMFLOOR -100r       # domains with top 100 number of requests
                     # (ditto -100p, -100b, -100d)
</pre>
The other <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> commands are <kbd>HOSTFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>REQFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>DIRFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>TYPEFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>REDIRFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>FAILFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REFFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>REFSITEFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>REDIRREFFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>FAILREFFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>FULLBROWFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>BROWFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>VHOSTFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>USERFLOOR</kbd>, <kbd>FAILUSERFLOOR</kbd>,
<kbd>STATUSFLOOR</kbd>. Once again, not every floor method is legal for
every report, but you'll be warned if you try and choose an illegal one.
<hr>
I've already told you about how to turn each report on and off from the
command line using its <a href="output.html">code letter</a>. In fact,
you can specify the <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> and the <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> in the same
command. Take the example of the Referrer Report. If you follow the
<kbd>+f</kbd> (to turn the report on) with a letter, it represents the
sort method according to the following code:
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd><kbd>REQUESTS</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd><kbd>PAGES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd><kbd>BYTES</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd><kbd>DATE</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd><kbd>ALPHABETICAL</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd><kbd>RANDOM</kbd>
</dl>
You can then, or alternatively, use one of the above <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> formats
to specify the floor. If you specify a <kbd>SORTBY</kbd>, you can also leave
off the last letter of the floor, and analog will guess it according to the
sort method: the floor will be by pages or bytes if that is the sort method,
and otherwise by requests. Here are four examples:
<dl compact>
<dt><kbd>+fp</kbd><dd>means turn the referrer report on and sort it by page
    requests, but says nothing about the floor;
<dt><kbd>+f100r</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with at least 100 requests,
    but says nothing about the sort method;
<dt><kbd>+fb10000</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with at least 10,000 bytes,
    sorted by bytes;
<dt><kbd>+fa-000101d</kbd><dd>means list all referrers with accesses this year,
    sorted alphabetically.
</dl>

<hr>
We've already seen some other commands affecting what was listed in the
non-time reports. The <a href="include.html">output <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands specified lines to omit from each report, and
the <kbd><a href="alias.html">OUTPUTALIAS</a></kbd> commands specified some
aliasing to do on the names before they were listed. There were also
<a href="include.html"><kbd>LINKINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>LINKEXCLUDE</kbd></a>,
and <a href="include.html"><kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFLINKEXCLUDE</kbd></a> commands to control what was linked to in the
Request Report and the three referrer reports. You might want to have another
look at these paragraphs.
<p>
There's one other command which affects the links in the Request Report.
The command <kbd>BASEURL</kbd> prepends an additional string to the URLs
in the target of the link. For example, after the command
<pre>
BASEURL http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk
</pre>
<kbd>/~sret1/</kbd> will be linked to
<kbd>http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/</kbd>, not just to
<kbd>/~sret1/</kbd>.
This is very useful if you want to display the
statistics on a different server from the server they refer to.
<p>
In the next section, we'll look at commands for generating
<a href="hierreps.html">hierarchical reports</a>, which are closely related
to the commands in this section.
