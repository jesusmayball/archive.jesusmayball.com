<h1>Readme for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog3.0</a></h1>
<h2>Starting to use analog under OS/2</h2>

When you've downloaded analog, and either you or your browser has unzipped
it, you will find in the analog directory a configuration file called
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> and the analog executable itself, as well as the Readme,
the <a href="Licence.txt">Licence</a> (which you must read and agree to before
using analog) and a couple of other files. You can run analog by just typing
<kbd>analog</kbd>. It should produce an output file called
<kbd>Report.html</kbd>.

<hr>
You can configure analog by putting commands in the configuration file,
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>. One command you will need straight away is
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename    # to set where your logfile lives
</pre>
You need to use <kbd>\</kbd> not <kbd>/</kbd> as the directory separator in
the logfile name. The logfile must live on your local disk -- analog doesn't
fetch it from across the network. There's a sample logfile supplied with the
program.

<p>
There's a list of <a href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a> later in the
Readme. Also there are a few to get you started in the configuration file
already, but there are lots of others available. You can read about all the
commands in the section on <a href="custom.html">customising analog</a>.

<p>
There is one other way to give options to analog, via command line arguments,
given on the command line after the program name. These are just shortcuts for
configuration file commands.

<p>
If you want to compile your own version of analog (it's written in C), or
just to read the source code, it's available from the
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog home page</a>.
(It's the same source code for all versions). There are
<a href="startux.html">instructions about compiling</a> on another page.
