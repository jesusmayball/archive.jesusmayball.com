<h1>Readme for

<h2>The domains file</h2>

The domains file tells analog which country is represented by each domain.
You can tell analog where to find your domains file with a command like
<pre>
DOMAINSFILE domains.tab
</pre>
This is useful if you want to use a domains file in a different language,
for example.
If you haven't got a domains file, you can download one from
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/domains.tab">http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/domains.tab</a>.
It should contain each domain code followed by its location on a new line,
thus:
<pre>
ad   Andorra
ae   United Arab Emirates
[...]
</pre>
It does not need to be in alphabetical order, though humans
may prefer it that way.

<p>
Only domains which occur in the domains file will get their own line in the
Domain Report: the rest are probably spurious, and will be accumulated
together as "unknown domains". If you have <a href="debug.html">debugging</a>
turned on, you can see which domains were unknown.
