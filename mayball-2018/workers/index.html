                <p>Jesus College May Ball is currently looking for motivated and enthusiastic workers to help make this year’s Ball a huge success.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of roles available, including Food and Drink workers, Security Stewards, and Entertainment Runners, as well as opportunities to take on a leadership position as a Team Leader or Court Supervisor.</p>
                <p>We do not operate a 'half-on, half-off' employment policy like many May Balls, and workers are offered a competitive rate which starts at £75 for the night and increases for certain roles.</p>
                <p>Applicants must be willing to work as part of a team and should demonstrate charisma and enthusiasm in order to make the 18th of June a spectacular night. Previous experience in hospitality or May Balls, whilst beneficial, is not essential.</p>
                <p>This is a great opportunity to be a part of one of the most exciting events of the year whilst earning some money.</p>
                <p>Our first round of interviews has already taken place, but please complete our online application below if you wish to be considered for our second hiring phase.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to email us for more information at <a href="mailto:staffing@jesusmayball.com">staffing@jesusmayball.com</a>.</p>
