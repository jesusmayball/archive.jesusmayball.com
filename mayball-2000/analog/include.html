<h1>Readme for

<h2>Inclusions and exclusions</h2>

After aliasing each item, analog decides whether that item is wanted or not.
The whole line is only counted if all the items are wanted. (If one type of
item doesn't occur on a line, that item's counted as wanted on that line.)
Whether an item is wanted or not is determined by <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands specified by the user. These commands can be used
to exclude requests from your local users, for example, or to analyse only
files in a subdirectory.

<p>
The rule for determining whether an item is included or excluded is as
follows. All the <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands for that
item are considered one by one in order, and the item is included or excluded
according to the last command it matched. Items which don't match any of
the <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands are included if the first
command was an exclusion, and excluded if the first command was an inclusion.
For example, the configuration
<pre>
FILEINCLUDE /~sret1/*
FILEEXCLUDE /~sret1/backgammon/*,/~sret1/analog/*
FILEINCLUDE /~sret1/backgammon/*.gif
</pre>
would instruct the program to examine only my files, excluding my
backgammon and analog files, but including gifs in my backgammon directory.
On the other hand,
<pre>
FILEEXCLUDE /~sret1/*/img/*
</pre>
would analyse all files, except for images in my various directories. Note that
inclusions and exclusions can contain any number of wildcards.
<p>
The relevant commands for the other types of item are <kbd>HOSTINCLUDE</kbd>
and <kbd>HOSTEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>BROWINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>BROWEXCLUDE</kbd>;
<kbd>REFINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>REFEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>USERINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>USEREXCLUDE</kbd>; and <kbd>VHOSTINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>VHOSTEXCLUDE</kbd>. If you get confused with all the inclusions and
exclusions, remember that you can always run <kbd>analog&nbsp;-settings</kbd>
to see what the options you have specified represent.
<hr>
There is also one other pair of commands which belongs in this category,
namely the <kbd>FROM</kbd> and <kbd>TO</kbd> commands. These specify a time
period to restrict the analysis to. The simplest usage of these commands is
<kbd>FROM yyMMdd</kbd> or <kbd>FROM yyMMdd:hhmm</kbd>, where <kbd>yy</kbd>
represents the last two digits of the year (analog assumes that the year is
between 1970 and 2069), <kbd>MM</kbd> represents the month,
<kbd>dd</kbd> is the date, <kbd>hh</kbd> the hour, and <kbd>mm</kbd> the
minute. So, for example, to analyse only requests from
July 1999 to June 2000 I would use the configuration
<pre>
FROM 990701
TO   000630
</pre>
Alternatively, each of the components can be preceded by <kbd>+</kbd> or
<kbd>-</kbd> to represent time relative to the time at which the program was
invoked. In this case, the date can have more than 2 digits. This allows
constructions like
<pre>
FROM -01-00+01   # from tomorrow last year
TO -00-0131  # to the end of last month (OK even if last month
             # didn't have 31 days)
FROM -00-00-112
TO   -00-00-01  # statistics for the last 16 weeks
FROM -00-00-00:-06+01  # statistics for the last 6 hours
</pre>
There are command line abbreviations <kbd>+F</kbd> and <kbd>+T</kbd>
for the <kbd>FROM</kbd> and <kbd>TO</kbd> commands; for example,
<kbd>+T-00-00-01:1800</kbd> looks at statistics until 6pm yesterday.
<kbd>-F</kbd> and <kbd>-T</kbd> turn off the from and to, as do <kbd>FROM
OFF</kbd> and <kbd>TO OFF</kbd>.
<hr>
There are also <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands for most of
the reports. These exclude individual lines from particular reports. So, for
example, the command
<pre>
REFREPEXCLUDE http://www.yahoo.com/*
</pre>
would exclude Yahoo! referrers from the referrer report. However, it would not
exclude them from the failed referrer report, the referring site report, etc.
(you need to use <kbd>FAILREFEXCLUDE</kbd>, <kbd>REFSITEEXCLUDE</kbd> etc. for
that); nor would it prevent other analysis of logfile lines with those
referrers, as <kbd>REFEXCLUDE</kbd> would. Also <kbd>REFREPEXCLUDE</kbd> would
include the referrers in the &quot;not listed&quot; line at the bottom of the
report.
<p>
The full list of these commands is <kbd>REQINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REQEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>REDIRINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>REDIREXCLUDE</kbd>;
<kbd>FAILINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>FAILEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>TYPEINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>TYPEEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>DIRINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>DIREXCLUDE</kbd>;
<kbd>HOSTREPINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>HOSTREPEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>DOMINCLUDE</kbd>
and <kbd>DOMEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>REFREPINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFREPEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>REFSITEINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFSITEEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>REDIRREFINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REDIRREFEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>FAILREFINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>FAILREFEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>BROWSUMINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>BROWSUMEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>FULLBROWINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>FULLBROWEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>VHOSTREPINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>VHOSTREPEXCLUDE</kbd>; <kbd>USERREPINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>USERREPEXCLUDE</kbd>; and <kbd>FAILUSERINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>FAILUSEREXCLUDE</kbd>. The inclusion or exclusion applies to the
unaliased name, if you are doing any <a href="alias.html">output aliases</a>.
<hr>
You can also use the symbolic word <kbd>pages</kbd> in suitable
<kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands; one very common command is
<pre>
REQINCLUDE pages
</pre>
to include only pages in the request report.
<p>
Analog determines which files should count as pages (and thus which requests
count as page requests) using another <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd>/<kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd>
pair, called <kbd>PAGEINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>PAGEEXCLUDE</kbd>.
By default, <kbd>*.html</kbd>, <kbd>*.htm</kbd> and directories (<kbd>*/</kbd>)
count as pages. But you change the list by commands like
<pre>
PAGEINCLUDE *.ps,*.ps.gz
PAGEEXCLUDE sret1.html
</pre>
(I.e., Postscript and gzipped Postscript are pages, but <kbd>sret1.html</kbd>
isn't).
<hr>
There are a couple more <kbd>INCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>EXCLUDE</kbd> commands
which I'll mention now while we're on the subject. In the Request Report
and the three referrer reports (Referrer Report, Redirected Referrer Report
and Failed Referrer Report), analog can link to the files which it's
listing. There are commands <kbd>LINKINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>LINKEXCLUDE</kbd>
for the Request Report, and <kbd>REFLINKINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFLINKEXCLUDE</kbd> for the referrer reports, to specify exactly which
files are linked to. (By default you get all pages). So, for example,
<kbd>
LINKINCLUDE *.txt
</kbd>
would link to <kbd>*.txt</kbd> files as well as pages in the Request Report,
and
<kbd>
REFLINKEXCLUDE *
</kbd>
would tell analog to make no links in the three referrer reports.
<p>
Finally, there are commands called <kbd>ARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>ARGSEXCLUDE</kbd>, and <kbd>REFARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and
<kbd>REFARGSEXCLUDE</kbd>. Sometimes a URL contains arguments after a question
mark. For example, the URL
<pre>
/cgi-bin/script.pl?x=1&amp;y=2
</pre>
runs the <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> program with arguments <kbd>x=1</kbd>
and <kbd>y=2</kbd>. (Sometimes the server records the arguments in a separate
field in the logfile, but if so you can use the <kbd>%q</kbd> field in the
<kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> command, and analog will
translate the filename to the above format).
<p>
Analog can either read or ignore the arguments. If the command
<kbd>
ARGSEXCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</kbd>
were given, analog would ignore the arguments to that file, and so treat the
above URL as being the same as <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd>. On the other
hand, if
<kbd>
ARGSINCLUDE /cgi-bin/script.pl
</kbd>
were specified, analog would read the arguments, and treat the above URL as
a different file from <kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> (or from
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl?y=2&amp;x=1</kbd>), although a grand total for
<kbd>/cgi-bin/script.pl</kbd> would still be listed in the Request Report.
<p>
<kbd>REFARGSINCLUDE</kbd> and <kbd>REFARGSEXCLUDE</kbd> are the same for
referrers. By default, all arguments are included. The check for whether the
arguments should be included happens before the filename is aliased: this
means that you can't use <kbd>pages</kbd> in this command, because we don't
know whether a file is a page until after it's been aliased.
