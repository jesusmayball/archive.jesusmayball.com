<h2>Configuring the output</h2>

So far we have mainly discussed commands which control how analog reads
the logfiles. We now get on to commands for configuring the output.

<p>
There are 27 different reports which analog can produce, if your logfiles
contain the necessary information. Each one has a short name, and a code
letter or number, as follows:
<pre>
x  <kbd>GENERAL</kbd>      General Summary
m  <kbd>MONTHLY</kbd>      Monthly Report
W  <kbd>WEEKLY</kbd>       Weekly Report
D  <kbd>FULLDAILY</kbd>    Daily Report
d  <kbd>DAILY</kbd>        Daily Summary
H  <kbd>FULLHOURLY</kbd>   Hourly Report
h  <kbd>HOURLY</kbd>       Hourly Summary
4  <kbd>QUARTER</kbd>      Quarter-Hour Report
5  <kbd>FIVE</kbd>         Five-Minute Report
S  <kbd>HOST</kbd>         Host Report
o  <kbd>DOMAIN</kbd>       Domain Report
r  <kbd>REQUEST</kbd>      Request Report
i  <kbd>DIRECTORY</kbd>    Directory Report
t  <kbd>FILETYPE</kbd>     File Type Report
z  <kbd>SIZE</kbd>         File Size Report
E  <kbd>REDIR</kbd>        Redirection Report
I  <kbd>FAILURE</kbd>      Failure Report
f  <kbd>REFERRER</kbd>     Referrer Report
s  <kbd>REFSITE</kbd>      Referring Site Report
k  <kbd>REDIRREF</kbd>     Redirected Referrer Report
K  <kbd>FAILREF</kbd>      Failed Referrer Report
B  <kbd>FULLBROWSER</kbd>  Browser Report
b  <kbd>BROWSER</kbd>      Browser Summary
v  <kbd>VHOST</kbd>        Virtual Host Report
u  <kbd>USER</kbd>         User Report
J  <kbd>FAILUSER</kbd>     Failed User Report
c  <kbd>STATUS</kbd>       Status Code Report
</pre>
For details on what the various reports mean, see the section on
<cite><a href="meaning.html">What the results mean</a></cite>. But in brief,
the General Summary gives summary statistics, such as the total number of
requests of each type. The next eight reports are known as <i>time
reports</i>; they show the pattern of requests over time. The Host Report
and the Domain Report show where people visited from. The Request Report,
Directory Report, File Type Report and Size Report show what files people got
from your server. The Redirection Report shows files which were redirected to
some other file, including &quot;click-thru's.&quot; The Failure Report shows
files which your server couldn't send out for some reason. The various
Referrer Reports show where people followed links from to reach your files.
(The Failed Referrer Report is good for spotting broken links.) The Browser
Report and Browser Summary show which browsers people were using. If you
are using virtual hosts, the Virtual Host Report shows how many requests
there were to each virtual host. Similarly if you are using user
authentication, the User Report and Failed User Report list the activity for
each user. Finally, the Status Code Report shows how many requests returned
each HTTP status code.

<hr>
You can turn each report on or off with configuration commands like
<pre>
FIVE OFF
REFSITE ON
</pre>
or by using command line arguments like <kbd>-5</kbd> and <kbd>+s</kbd>.
You can also turn all reports except the General Summary on or off with the
commands <kbd>ALL ON</kbd> and <kbd>ALL OFF</kbd>, or with the command line
arguments <kbd>+A</kbd> and <kbd>-A</kbd>.
<p>
You can turn the &quot;Go To&quot; lines in the report off with the command
<pre>
GOTOS OFF
</pre>
or with the <kbd>-X</kbd> command line argument; again, <kbd>GOTOS ON</kbd>
and <kbd>+X</kbd> turn them on again.
<p>
The figures in parentheses in the General Summary are for the last seven days:
either the seven days before the <kbd>TO</kbd> time, or if no <kbd>TO</kbd>
time is given, the seven days before the time of the program start. The
figures for the last seven days are normally included if some, but not all,
of the requests fall in those seven days; but you can turn them off by means
of the command
<pre>
LASTSEVEN OFF
</pre>
Of course <kbd>LASTSEVEN ON</kbd> turns them on again.
<p>
You can change the order of the reports by means of the <kbd>REPORTORDER</kbd>
command. You should list the code letters for all the reports in the order
you want them, like this:
<pre>
REPORTORDER xcmdDhH45WriSoEItzsfKkuJvbB
</pre>

<p>
You can change which file the output goes to with a command like
<pre>
OUTFILE stats.htm
</pre>
or with a command line argument like <kbd>+Ostats.htm</kbd>. If you use the
filename <kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>stdout</kbd>, the output will go to standard
output, which is normally the screen, but Unix users might like to redirect it
to another file or even into a pipe. You can also use an absolute path name,
like
<pre>
OUTFILE /usr/bin/httpd/htdocs/stats.html  # Unix
OUTFILE Hard Disk:Server Apps:WebSTAR:Analog:Report.html" # Mac
</pre>

<hr>
Now we come to some very important commands. The first is the <kbd>OUTPUT</kbd>
command, which changes the style of the output. There are three possible output
styles, <kbd>HTML</kbd>, <kbd>ASCII</kbd> and <kbd>COMPUTER</kbd>. The first
produces Web pages, the second plain text files (which you could mail to
people, for example) and the third produces output suitable for reading by a
computer (useful for reading into a spreadsheet, or post-processing with a
graphics package, for example). 
There is a separate section about the <cite><a href="compout.html">Computer
readable output</a></cite> later. As well as a command like
<pre>
OUTPUT ASCII
</pre>
you can also select <kbd>ASCII</kbd> style with the command line argument
<kbd>+a</kbd>, and <kbd>HTML</kbd> with the command line argument
<kbd>-a</kbd>. You can also specify <kbd>OUTPUT NONE</kbd>
for no output, if you are producing a <a href="cache.html">cache file</a>.
<p>
Next, you can change the language of the output. There are two ways to do
this. The usual way is to use the <kbd>LANGUAGE</kbd> command. For example,
the command
<pre>
LANGUAGE FRENCH
</pre>
will give you the output in French. The possible languages at the moment
are <kbd>ENGLISH</kbd>, <kbd>US-ENGLISH</kbd>, <kbd>FRENCH</kbd>,
<kbd>GERMAN</kbd>, <kbd>ITALIAN</kbd>, <kbd>PORTUGUESE</kbd>,
<kbd>BR-PORTUGUESE</kbd>, <kbd>DANISH</kbd>, <kbd>SWEDISH</kbd>,
<kbd>CZECH</kbd>, <kbd>SLOVAK</kbd>, <kbd>HUNGARIAN</kbd>, <kbd>ROMANIAN</kbd>
and <kbd>SLOVENE</kbd>.
<p>
The other way is to use the <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd> command. This is useful if
you want to download a new language from the
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog home page</a>,
or if you want to translate one yourself, or even if you want to change some
words or phrases or the way the dates and times are formatted in the output.
The <kbd>LANGFILE</kbd> command tells analog in which file to find the various
words and phrases for a new language. For example, the command
<pre>
LANGFILE lang/guarani.lng
</pre>
would read from that file. (Note that you have to include the directory name
if the file isn't in the directory or folder which you're running analog
from. In particular, it's not assumed to be in the same directory as the other
language files.)
<p>
Some languages also have domains files available. You can tell analog to
use a different domains file instead of the English one using the
<kbd><a href="domfile.html">DOMAINSFILE</a></kbd> command.
<p>
If you want to translate another language, I would be delighted! You'd be
wise to contact me first to make sure that no-one else is already translating
the same language. The English language file contains some brief instructions
for translating new languages.

<hr>
There are a few more minor, although cosmetically important, commands
affecting the output. First there's a command <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd> which tells
analog where the various images used to make the report live. It could be a
relative or an absolute URL: for example
<pre>
IMAGEDIR img/   # within the same directory as the output
IMAGEDIR /img/  # off the root directory of your server
</pre>
<p>
There are three commands which affect the top line of the output. First,
the <kbd>LOGO</kbd> command allows you to replace the analog logo with
another image (for example, your organisation's logo). You can say
<pre>
LOGO picture.gif  # for this file
LOGO /images/picture2.gif  # a different file
LOGO none         # for no logo
</pre>
The logo is assumed to be inside the <kbd>IMAGEDIR</kbd> unless it starts
with a slash, or contains <kbd>://</kbd>
<p>
hen there are commands <kbd>HOSTNAME</kbd> and <kbd>HOSTURL</kbd> which
affect the name and link at the end of the title line. For example, I might
specify
<pre>
HOSTNAME "Stephen Turner"
HOSTURL  http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/
</pre>
to generate the title &quot;Web Server Statistics for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/">Stephen Turner</a>&quot;.
Again, you can use <kbd>none</kbd> as the <kbd>HOSTURL</kbd> to specify no
link. Analog will normally translate characters in the hostname to HTML if
necessary. So to include literal HTML, such as accented characters, in the
output you need to precede them by a backslash, like this: 
<pre>
HOSTNAME &quot;M\&amp;uuml;ller &amp; S\&amp;ouml;hne&quot;
</pre>
<p>
There are commands called <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd> and <kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>.
These let you specify files to be inserted near the top and bottom of your
output. You can specify
<pre>
HEADERFILE none
</pre>
to cancel a previously-specified header file.
<p>
There are three related commands called <kbd>SEPCHAR</kbd>,
<kbd>REPSEPCHAR</kbd> and <kbd>DECPOINT</kbd>. These specify single characters
to be used as the thousands separator in numbers, the thousands separator
within the columns in the reports, and the decimal point. For example, a
French user might choose
<pre>
SEPCHAR " "
REPSEPCHAR none
DECPOINT ,
</pre>
to make &quot;three thousand and a quarter&quot; look like
&quot;3&nbsp;000,25&quot; in text and &quot;3000,25&quot; in the reports.
<p>
There is a command called <kbd>RAWBYTES</kbd>. Specify <kbd>RAWBYTES ON</kbd>
if you want the exact number of bytes to be listed in reports, or
<kbd>RAWBYTES OFF</kbd> if you want the number of kilobytes or Megabytes
as appropriate to be listed instead.
<p>
Finally there is a command called <kbd>PAGEWIDTH</kbd> which specifies the
width of the page. The output is not guaranteed to fit in this width, but
analog will take notice of it when choosing the width of the time graphs,
and when sorting the host report alphabetically; and if the output format
is <kbd>ASCII</kbd>, when drawing horizontal rules and printing some bits
of text. I recommend about <kbd>PAGEWIDTH 65</kbd> for HTML output, and
<kbd>PAGEWIDTH 75</kbd> for ASCII output.
