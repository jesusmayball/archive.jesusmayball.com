<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>When I try and compile analog, it gives me an error.</b>
  <li><b>Analog just runs for a moment and then quits.</b>
  <li><b>Analog didn't write the logfile when I ran it.</b>
      <br>See the section entitled <cite><a href="start.html">Starting to use
      analog</a></cite>.
  <li><b>Is analog Year 2000 compatible?</b>
      <br>Yes (and so are all previous versions). It works properly for dates
      between 1970 &amp; 2069 inclusive.
  <li><b>My stats have stopped updating.</b>
  <li><b>My stats have reset to zero.</b>
      <br>If your ISP runs analog for you, you'll have to ask them.
  <li><b>How do I find out the number of hits from your data?</b>
      <br>I don't use the word <i>hits</i>, because people use it in
      different ways, so it's misleading. I use <i>requests</i> for the
      number of transfers of any type of file (text, graphics, ...), and
      <i>page requests</i> for the number of transfers of HTML pages. See the
      section on <cite><a href="defns.html">Analog's definitions</a></cite>
      for more information.
  <li><b>Why doesn't the Daily Report only show the last six weeks?</b>
      <br>This is controlled by the
      <kbd><a href="timereps.html">FULLDAYROWS</a></kbd> command.
  <li><b>How do I get information on just my pages, not everybody's?</b>
  <li><b>How do I ignore accesses from my site?</b>
      <br>Use the <kbd><a href="include.html">FILEINCLUDE</a></kbd> command
      or <kbd><a href="include.html">HOSTEXCLUDE</a></kbd> command
      respectively.
  <li><b>I want to make several different statistics pages. Do I have to
      install several copies of analog?</b>
      <br>No. Just install it once, and run it with different
      <a href="syntax.html">configuration files</a>.
  <li><b>Can I get data on individual visitors, or visits, to my site?</b>
      <br>No, it's not technically possible, and don't believe any program
      which tells you it is. See the section on
      <cite><a href="webworks.html">How the web works</a></cite> for details.
  <li><b>I want to see the total number of hits from my organisation in the
      Host Report.</b>
      <br>You can see this in the Domain Report if you use the
      <kbd><a href="hierreps.html">SUBDOMAIN</a></kbd> command.
  <li><b>Do I have to save all my old logfiles?</b>
      <br>This is answered in the section about
      <cite><a href="cache.html">Cache files</a></cite>.
  <li><b>What does this error (or warning) mean?</b>
      <br>See the section on <cite><a href="errors.html">Errors and
      warnings</a></cite>.
  <li><b>Why doesn't analog agree with the counter on my page?</b>
      <br>There are lots of possible reasons. Do they both start from
      the same date? Are you just looking at requests for that one page with
      analog, not for all your other pages and graphics? Also, analog will
      record all requests to that page; if it's a graphic, your counter will
      only measure requests from people on graphical browsers that reached
      that place on the page.
  <li><b>How can I do such-and-such with a commandline option?</b>
      <br>Use the <kbd><a href="syntax.html">+C</a></kbd> option to put any
      configuration command on the commandline.
  <li><b>Why does the form interface give &quot;Document Returned no
      Data&quot;?</b>
      <br>If it doesn't happen for a while, then probably the server is giving
      up before the analog process has finished running. Increase the timeout
      interval on the server.
  <li><b>The images don't appear when running analog from the form
      interface.</b>
      <br>You probably need to change the
      <kbd><a href="output.html">IMAGEDIR</a></kbd>. If the images are in your
      <kbd>/cgi-bin/</kbd> directory, the server will try to execute them
      instead of just sending them out.
  <li><b>Can I find out the number of hosts that have accessed each file?</b>
  <li><b>Can I find out the number of hosts visiting on each day?</b>
      <br>No; it would require storing too much data (all host/file pairs, or
      all host/day pairs). If there's a particular file you're interested in,
      use <kbd><a href="include.html">FILEINCLUDE</a></kbd> to restrict the
      analysis to only that file. If there's a particular day you're
      interested in, use <a href="include.html"><kbd>FROM</kbd> and
      <kbd>TO</kbd></a> to restrict the analysis to only that day.
  <li><b>How can I run analog every day?</b>
      <br>This depends on your particular machine. On Unix, you need to run
      analog as a cron job (see &quot;man cron&quot;). This is my cron command:
      <br><kbd>20 1 * * * $HOME/misc/analog</kbd>
      <br>On Windows NT you can do the same with the at command, but only an
      administrator can run at. On Windows 95 it's not possible.
      <br>On Mac, there are programs called
      <a href="http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/cfg/chris-cron-10a7.hqx">Cron</a> or
      <a href="http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/app/time/">CronoTask</a>
      to do this.
  <li><b>How can I specify different logfiles from the form interface?</b>
      <br>Just add a new field to the form with <kbd>name=lo</kbd>
  <li><b>Why are directories listed in the request report?</b>
      <br>They are not directories, they are pages with the same name as
      the directory. For example, I have a directory called <kbd>/analog/</kbd>
      and a page called <kbd>/analog/</kbd> (which is the same as
      <kbd>/analog/index.html</kbd>).
  <li><b>Why don't you just use one image, and scale it with the
      <kbd>WIDTH</kbd> and <kbd>HEIGHT</kbd> attributes?</b>
      <br>The <kbd>WIDTH</kbd> and <kbd>HEIGHT</kbd> only tell the browser
      what size the image will be. They cannot be used for scaling the image,
      whatever some browsers do.
  <li><b>There is a CTRL-Z character in my logfile, and analog stops reading
      there.</b>
      <br>Analog is behaving correctly. Under Windows, CTRL-Z (ASCII 26)
      signifies end-of-file in a text file.
  <li><b>Why do I only get "unresolved numerical addresses" in the domain
      report?</b>
      <br>Your server only records the numerical IP address of the hosts that
      contact you, not their names. Read the section about
      <cite><a href="dns.html">DNS lookups</a></cite>.
  <li><b>Couldn't you do the DNS lookups faster with threads?</b>
      <br>The problem is, the standard commands for DNS lookups are not
      thread-safe on most Unices.
  <li><b>How about an operating system report?</b>
      <br>Unfortunately, this is not possible. Many browsers record their
      operating system in your browser log, but not all do, and those that do
      don't always record it in a consistent format.
  <li><b>How do I make a link on my page that runs analog?</b>
      <br>Link to the <a href="form.html">analform</a> program, with the
      desired options. But be careful about the load on your server.
  <li><b>My server lists local names in the logfile. Can you put a common
      suffix on them automatically?</b>
      <br>This wouldn't be a good idea, because things like &quot;unknown&quot;
      would get the suffix. You can always add them using
      <kbd><a href="alias.html">HOSTALIAS</a></kbd>.
  <li><b>Why don't you make proper graphs or tables?</b>
      <br>Because lots of people then couldn't read them. Analog produces
      HTML 2.0 output so that people with any browser can read it. Also, I
      don't want to assume that people have any particular graphics creation
      tools.
  <li><b>Can I change the background colour of my output?</b>
      <br>Sadly not. Colours only exist in HTML 3.2, not HTML 2.0.
      Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to produce the bar charts
      in my time reports in HTML 3.2.
  <li><b>Can you extrapolate from the current month's partial data to produce
      a prediction for the whole month, based on the rate so far?</b>
      <br>No. There are too many problems in trying to produce anything
      sensible, especially near the beginning of the month. Different days of
      the week and different times of day cause lots of problems. I would
      prefer to produce raw accurate data than suspect derived data.
  <li><b>Can you extend the Domain Report to say which US states people visited
      from?</b>
      <br>No. Some programs pretend to do this, but you can only tell which
      state the computer they're using is in, which may be quite different
      from where the user is for ISP's or other large organisations.
  <li><b>Can I make multiple reports with one pass through the logfile?</b>
      <br>Not at the moment. I want to do this in a future version, but it will
      require some considerable work.
  <li><b>I ran out of memory when trying to run analog. What can I do?</b>
      <br>See the section on <a href="lowmem.html">Coping with low memory</a>.
  <li><b>You're processing 10,000,000 requests in under 10 minutes. Why is mine
      much slower?</b>
  <li><b>Analog appears to stall.</b>
      <br>If you have <a href="dns.html">DNS lookups</a> on, they are very
      slow. Otherwise, it probably depends on the speed of your computer and
      disks, and what other programs are running at the same time. You can
      use the <kbd><a href="debug.html">PROGRESSFREQ</a></kbd> command to see
      if it's really stalled or whether it's just being slow.
  <li><b>I host lots of virtual domains. How should I set up analog?</b>
      <br>In my opinion, the best thing is to log each virtual server to a
      different logfile and analyse them independently. If you log them all to
      the same logfile, then make sure to log the virtual host name on each
      line, and use analog's <a href="include.html">VHOSTINCLUDE</a> command
      to pick out the lines you want.
  <li><b>Why don't you sell analog?</b>
      <br>I didn't write analog for the money, and I'm happy just to see
      people use it. I haven't got time to support it commercially, and I
      can't use my academic account for commercial purposes. Also, by making
      it freeware, lots of people send me ideas and code to include in future
      versions. (Of course, if you want to send me money, or gifts in kind,
      or even just postcards...).
