<h1>Readme for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog3.0</a></h1>
<h2>Starting to use analog under Windows 95 &amp; NT</h2>

When you've downloaded analog, and either you or your browser has unzipped
it, you will find in the analog directory a configuration file called
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> and the analog executable itself, as well as the Readme,
the <a href="Licence.txt">Licence</a> (which you must read and agree to before
using analog) and a couple of other files.

<p>
There are two ways of running analog. You can either run it from Windows
by double-clicking on its icon, or you can run it from the DOS command
prompt (under Start-Programs). If you run it from Windows, it will create a
DOS window to run in. When it's finished, it will produce an output file called
<kbd>Report.html</kbd>.

<hr>
You can configure analog by putting commands in the configuration file,
<kbd>analog.cfg</kbd>. One command you will need straight away is
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename    # to set where your logfile lives
</pre>
The logfile must live on your local disk -- analog doesn't fetch it from
across the network. There's a sample logfile supplied with the program.

<p>
There's a list of <a href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a> later in the
Readme. Also there are a few to get you started in the configuration file
already, but there are lots of others available. You can read about all the
commands in the section on <a href="custom.html">customising analog</a>.

<p>
In some ways, it's easier to run analog from the DOS command prompt, because
you get to see any error or warning messages more easily. Also, if you run
analog from the command prompt, there is another way to give options, via
command line arguments, given on the command line after the program name.
These are just shortcuts for configuration file commands.

<p>
If you want to compile your own version of analog (it's written in C), or
just to read the source code, it's available from the
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog home page</a>.
(It's the same source code for all versions).
