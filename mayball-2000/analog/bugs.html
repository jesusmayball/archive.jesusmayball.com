<h1>Readme for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog3.0</a></h1>
<h2>How to report bugs</h2>

I welcome mail about analog, both praise and bug reports! I am also usually
happy to help people who have trouble with analog: it helps me to find bugs,
and know where the documentation is unclear.

<p>
I get a lot of e-mail about analog, so I would appreciate it if you would
do the following simple things before mailing me.
<ol>
  <li>Read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>. Maybe I've answered your question
      already. If I have, I'll just direct you to the FAQ, not answer it
      again.
  <li>Read the
      <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/bugs.html">list of
      known bugs</a> at my site, to see if your bug is already known about.
  <li>Read the other relevant pages of the Readme, particularly the section
      on <cite><a href="start.html">Starting to use analog</a></cite>, and the
      section on <cite><a href="errors.html">Errors and warnings</a></cite>
      if your question is about one of those. If your question is already
      answered on one of those pages, I'll just direct you to it, not answer
      the question again.
  <li>If your question is &quot;How do I do ... with analog&quot; then don't
      ask it until you've read the whole of the section on
      <cite><a href="custom.html">Customising analog</a></cite> yourself, and
      still don't know how to do it. I don't appreciate people who are too
      lazy to read the documentation. (If the documentation is unclear, or the
      relevant paragraph is too well hidden, then that's a different
      matter. Of course I want to know about that.)
  <li>If analog isn't doing what you thought you asked it to, then run it with
      the <kbd><a href="debug.html">PRINTVARS ON</a></kbd> configuration
      command, and see what options it thinks it's meant to be using.
  <li>Describe exactly what you did, what you expected, and what the computer
      did. Include the <em>exact text</em> of any error messages, not a
      pr&eacute;cis.
  <li>Do <strong>not</strong> send long files or attachments unless I ask you
      to. I do not want to see your configuration file, your header file, your
      output file, or any logfile over 20 lines long. They are almost always
      useless to me.
  <li>Include the word &quot;analog&quot; in the subject of your e-mail. That
      way it will end up in the right mailbox.
</ol>
<p>
I'm sorry to be so fussy, but a lot of the mail I get really needn't have been
sent at all. As I say, I really do welcome genuine mail. After all that, you
can send your mail to <a href="mailto:sret1@cam.ac.uk">sret1@cam.ac.uk</a>.
<p>
There is also a mailing list for receiving news of updates to analog. To join
that list, see the <a href="mailing.html">next section</a>.
