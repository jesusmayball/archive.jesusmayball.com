<h2>Computer-readable output style</h2>

This section describes the computer-readable output style. You can select
this style by means of the command
<pre>
OUTPUT COMPUTER
</pre>
This style is designed to be easy to read into spreadsheets, or post-process
with graphics creation tools, for example.

<p>
Each line in the output is separated into fields by means of a special string.
You can specify this string by means of the <kbd>COMPSEP</kbd> command; for
example
<pre>
COMPSEP :::
</pre>
if for some reason you wanted three colons between each column. Make sure not
to use anything that might occur in the output: for example, a single or
double space would not be suitable.

<p>
Each line in the preformatted output begins with a letter indicating which
report the line is part of. (The code letters for the reports are listed in
the section on <cite><a href="output.html">Configuring the Output</a></cite>.)
After that, there follows a field indicating the remaining columns in the
report (using the letters <kbd>RrPpBbD</kbd> as usual). Then there are the
numerical data and then the name of the item. Times actually take up several
fields: year, month, date, hour &amp; minute, or as many of those as are
necessary to identify the time.

<p>
The general summary is a bit different. After an initial <kbd>x</kbd>, there is
a two-character code saying what the line contains. The possible codes are
<dl compact>
  <dt><kbd>HN</kbd><dd><kbd>HOSTNAME</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>HU</kbd><dd><kbd>HOSTURL</kbd>
  <dt><kbd>PS</kbd><dd>Program start time
  <dt><kbd>FR</kbd><dd>Time of first request
  <dt><kbd>LR</kbd><dd>Time of last request
  <dt><kbd>L7</kbd><dd>Time last 7 days starts after
  <dt><kbd>SR</kbd><dd>Total successful requests
  <dt><kbd>S7</kbd><dd>Total successful requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>PR</kbd><dd>Total successful requests for pages
  <dt><kbd>P7</kbd><dd>Total successful requests for pages in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>FL</kbd><dd>Total failed requests
  <dt><kbd>F7</kbd><dd>Total failed requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>RR</kbd><dd>Total redirected requests
  <dt><kbd>R7</kbd><dd>Total redirected requests in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NC</kbd><dd>Logfile lines without status code
  <dt><kbd>C7</kbd><dd>Lines without status code in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NF</kbd><dd>Number of distinct files requested
  <dt><kbd>N7</kbd><dd>Number of distinct files requested in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>NH</kbd><dd>Number of distinct hosts served
  <dt><kbd>H7</kbd><dd>Number of distinct hosts served in last 7 days
  <dt><kbd>CL</kbd><dd>Number of corrupt lines in the logfile
  <dt><kbd>UL</kbd><dd>Number of unwanted lines in the logfile
  <dt><kbd>BT</kbd><dd>Total number of bytes transferred
  <dt><kbd>B7</kbd><dd>Total number of bytes transferred in last 7 days
</dl>

<p>
If you do anything interesting with this output style, I should be delighted
to hear about it. Anyone want to write a program to turn it into those pretty
charts that executives seem to love?
