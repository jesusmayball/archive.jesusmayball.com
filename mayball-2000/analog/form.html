<h2>Form interface</h2>

The form interface provides an HTML front end to analog. That means that users
can select options from a web page, instead of having to create a configuration
file.

<p>
The form interface is suitable for ordinary users to use, but it <b>needs to be
set up by a system administrator</b> or other expert. In order to set it up,
you need to know what CGI programs are, where they live on your server, and how
to set up their permissions properly. It would also be hepful if you can write
HTML forms. I shall assume this level of background knowledge for the rest of
this section.

<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> CGI programs can contain security loopholes which
allow an unscrupulous user to harm your system. (If you don't know about this,
you shouldn't be running CGI programs at all.) I have tried to make this
form interface safe, but I cannot guarantee it, and take no responsibility
if anything goes wrong. You use it at your own risk. (See the
<a href="Licence.txt">licence</a>.)

<p>
The form interface consists of two parts: a form to choose the options, and a
cgi program to interpret them and pass them to the analog program. You don't
in fact need the form at all: if you want to create a link to the cgi program,
with the arguments passed in the URL in the usual way, then that's fine.

<p>
To compile the cgi program, you first need to edit the top of
<kbd>anlgform.c</kbd> to indicate where analog lives on your system. Then type
<kbd>make form</kbd>, which should compile this source into a program called
<kbd>anlgform.cgi</kbd>. (On Windows 95 &amp; NT, the cgi program is compiled
already: it assumes that analog is at
<kbd>\Program&nbsp;Files\analog\analog.exe</kbd>, so you must move analog
there if necessary.) Then put the cgi program wherever your server can find it.
Make sure that analog is executable by the server, and that the logfile and
domains file are readable. You will probably need to use the full path name
for these files.

<p>
The form <kbd>anlgform.html</kbd> which is distributed with the program should
only be regarded as an example form. Almost every configuration command has a
counterpart in the CGI program, and so you can add to the form options to do
almost anything you want. (The main exceptions are aliases, which are too
complicated, and <kbd>HEADERFILE</kbd> and <kbd>FOOTERFILE</kbd>, which would
allow people to view any file on your system.) I shall give the full list in
a minute.

<p>
Before you use the form, you must edit the action at the top to indicate
where <kbd>anlgform.cgi</kbd> lives on your server. I have also included
two other important options at the top, commented out. First, it is often
useful to set the logfile to be analysed (or allow the user to choose it),
with a field with <kbd>name=&quot;lo&quot;</kbd>. Secondly, some servers need
a timezone to be set in a field with <kbd>name=&quot;TZ&quot;</kbd>, or all
the times will be wrong. If you are on Unix, you can put any of the standard
timezones in this field: the correct one may well be in your own <kbd>TZ</kbd>
environment variable.

<p>
You can specify other configuration files to be included.
When analog is called by the CGI program, it first processes the
<a href="syntax.html">default configuration file</a> as usual. Then it
processes any configuration file specified by an argument with name
<kbd>cg</kbd>. Then it processes all the other arguments which the CGI program
specifies. After that, it processes any configuration file specified by an
argument with name <kbd>cm</kbd>. Finally, it processes the
<a href="syntax.html">mandatory configuration file</a> as usual.

<p>
If the option <kbd>qv=1</kbd> is sent to the CGI program, then analog is not
run, but a list of the configuration commands which would have been sent to
analog is printed instead. This is useful for checking that the CGI program
is working properly. It can also be used for using the form to produce a
configuration file.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

There are lots of reasons why the form interface may not work, and I can't
diagnose them very easily. If it doesn't work, first check the following
points:
<ol>
  <li>Look in the server's error log for clues.
  <li>Are all the file permissions set correctly? Do other CGI programs
      work on your server?
  <li>Include <kbd>qv=1</kbd> in the arguments as explained above. If this
      works, then at least the CGI program is working.
  <li>If you get a long wait, then no data returned, the server is probably
      timing out the request before analog has finished. The remedy is to
      increase the timeout interval.
  <li>Try running the cgi program from the shell. Set the environment variable
      <kbd>QUERY_STRING</kbd> to equal &quot;<kbd>xq=1</kbd>&quot;, or
      &quot;<kbd>xq=1&qv=1</kbd>&quot;, and run <kbd>anlgform.cgi</kbd>
      directly.
  <li>If everything works but the images don't appear in the output, be
      careful about the <kbd><a href="output.html">IMAGEDIR</a></kbd>.
      It probably shouldn't be inside your <kbd>/cgi-bin/</kbd> directory,
      or your server will try and execute the images, not send them out.
</ol>
 
<hr>
Here is the complete list of options which can be added to the form and will
be interpreted by the CGI program. Each has a two letter name. Values are the
same as for the corresponding configuration command except where stated.

<h2>Time reports</h2>

The first letter is the <a href="output.html">standard code letter</a> for the
report, except that the Quarter-Hour Report is <kbd>q</kbd> and the Five-Minute
Report is <kbd>p</kbd>. The second letter is as follows. If the first letter is
lower case, read the column marked lc; if it is upper case, read uc. So, for
example, <kbd>FIVECOLS</kbd> is <kbd>pc</kbd>, but <kbd>WEEKCOLS</kbd> is
<kbd>Wd</kbd>.
<pre>
        lc   uc    value
ON/OFF   q    p    1 for on, 0 for off
GRAPH    g    h
ROWS     r    s
COLS     c    d
</pre>

<h2>Other reports</h2>

Again, the first letter is the <a href="output.html">code letter</a> for the
report. The second letter is
<pre>
                lc   uc    value
ON/OFF           q    p    1 for on, 0 for off
