<h2>Starting to use analog on other platforms</h2>

If you're not using a Mac or a PC, you'll have to compile your own
version of analog from the source. But don't worry -- it's written in
standard C throughout, so it will compile out of the box on most platforms.
(The source code is the same for all platforms.)

<p>
First, you will want to look at the file analhead.h. These are all
user-settable options, but most of them you can override later. You will
probably want to check the first few options in the file, but you can even
leave most of them until later.

<p>
When you have done that, you need to compile the program. How to do that
depends on which system you're using.

<hr>
<b>Compiling under Unix</b>. Just type
<pre>
make
</pre>
to compile the program. On most systems, that will be sufficient. If it
fails to compile, have a look in the Makefile to see if there's anything that
you need to change to suit your configuration, and try again. It says in that
file what to do. In particular, <b>Solaris 2 (SunOS 5)</b> users need to
change the <kbd>LIBS=</kbd> line (and may need to change the <kbd>DEFS=</kbd>
line -- see below).
<p>
If you haven't got gcc, you will need to change the compiler - try acc or cc
instead. If it still doesn't compile, try <kbd>DEFS=-DNODNS</kbd> to ignore the
DNS lookup code.
<p>
There is a known problem with <b>HP-UX 10</b> and some versions of gcc. If it
complains about an error in the <kbd>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</kbd> library, you
need to upgrade to gcc version 2.7.2.3 or later, or use HP's cc compiler.
HP's compiler is not an ANSI C compiler by default, so you need to specify
<kbd>-Ae</kbd> in the <kbd>CFLAGS</kbd> to tell the compiler to use ANSI C.
<p>
<b>SunOS 4</b>'s cc doesn't seem to have the necessary header files for
ANSI C. Often gcc doesn't work either -- you will probably need to use acc.
<p>
<b>SunOS 5</b> sometimes seems to have a broken <kbd>strcmp()</kbd> function.
If you get an "illegal instruction" error when running analog, compile it
with the <kbd>-DNOSTRCMP</kbd> in the <kbd>DEFS=</kbd> line.
<p>
<b>Compiling under VMS</b>. Type
<pre>
MMS
</pre>
to compile analog. Under <b>VMS 7.0 &amp; 7.1</b>, there is a VMS bug that
stops analog compiling.
The fix is to add &quot;<kbd>/define=(_VMS_V6_SOURCE)</kbd>&quot; to the
cflags definitions at the top of the file <kbd>descrip.mms</kbd>.
<p>
<b>Compiling under Acorn RiscOS</b>. The Makefile is called
<kbd>Make.Risc</kbd>, and you will have to rename it to <kbd>Makefile</kbd>
before running make. Also you have to make directories called <kbd>C</kbd>,
<kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd>, and move the sources files into the appropriate
directories: e.g., <kbd>alias.c</kbd> must be renamed <kbd>C.alias</kbd>. And
you will find that there are some filenames in the header file
<kbd>analhead.h</kbd> that you want to change to fit into the RiscOS directory
structure.
<p>
<b>Compiling under OS/2</b>. Although there is a precompiled version of
analog for OS/2, if you want to compile your own you will need the
<a href="ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/">EMX package</a>. You should
edit the Makefile to have <kbd>OS=OS2</kbd>. Then after running Make, you
need to run the command
<pre>
EMXBIND -b ANALOG
</pre>
to generate the analog.exe executable.
<hr>
After you've made the program, just type
<pre>
analog
</pre>
to run the program. (Or <kbd>./analog</kbd> if for some reason <kbd>.</kbd>
isn't in your <kbd>$PATH</kbd>.)

<p>
You can configure analog by putting commands in the configuration file,
which is called <kbd>analog.cfg</kbd> by default. Two commands you will need
straight away are
<pre>
LOGFILE logfilename      # to set where your logfile lives
OUTFILE outputfile.html  # to send the output to a file instead of the screen
</pre>
The logfile must live on your local disk -- analog doesn't fetch it from
across the network. There's a sample logfile supplied with the program.

<p>
There's a list of <a href="basiccmd.html">basic commands</a> later in the
Readme. Also there are a few to get you started in the configuration file
already, but there are lots of others available. You can read about all the
commands in the section on <a href="custom.html">customising analog</a>.

<p>
There is one other way to give options to analog, via command line arguments,
given on the command line after the program name. These are just shortcuts for
configuration file commands.
