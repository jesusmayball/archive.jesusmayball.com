<h1>Readme for
<a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/">analog3.0</a></h1>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

Many people have helped me with analog, and I can't thank them all
specifically. But I do appreciate everyone who's given me feedback or sent me
bug reports.

<p>
Thanks are due to the author of
<a HREF="http://www.eit.com/software/getstats/">getstats</a>,
Kevin Hughes. In the days before analog there were only three serious logfile
analysis programs, and only one of them, getstats, had attractive output. I
wrote analog when getstats stopped being able to cope with the size of our
logfile, but my output still looks similar to his.

<p>
Thanks are also due to all those who helped in the early stages of writing
this program, and gave me the encouragement to continue with analog and to
release it publicly. Those who made helpful suggestions during beta testing are
numerous, but I must mention particularly Dan Anderson, Martyn Johnson,
Joe Ramey, Chris Ritson, Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Dave Stanworth. Above
all Gareth McCaughan gave, and continues to give, me lots of programming
advice. The program would have run much more slowly without him.

<p>
Many people have provided mirror sites for analog, starting with
Dave Stanworth (again!). The full list of mirror sites is listed <a
href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/mirrors.html">elsewhere</a>;
thanks to all of them.

<p>
Mark Roedel first suggested porting analog to different platforms, and made
the original DOS port. Shortly afterwards, Jason Linhart made the Mac port,
and has continued to contribute lots of extra code for that platform and for
the program in general. The Mac version also includes code contributed by
Stephan Somogyi and Nigel Perry, and uses the
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">ZLib library</a> by
Jean-loup Gailly &amp; Mark Adler.
Later ports were made by Dave Jones (VMS), Magnus Hagander (Win32),
Nick Smith (Acorn RiscOS), Scott Tadman (BeOS), and Martin Kraemer &amp;
Holger Schranz (BS2000/OSD). Ivan Martinez compiles the OS/2 version.
The BS2000/OSD port includes code developed  by the Apache Group for use in
the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache HTTP server project</a>.
Thanks to all the other people who have contributed bits of code too.

<p>
For the translations into other languages, many thanks are due to the
following: Patrice Lafont, Lucien Vieira, Jean-Marc Coursimault &amp;
Lionel Delaude (French), Mario Ellebrecht, Martin Kraemer, Holger Schranz
&amp; Thomas Jacob (German), Furio Ercolessi (Italian), Adrian Price (Danish),
Bj&ouml;rn Malmberg (Swedish), Ivan Martinez (Brazilian Portuguese), Jaime
Carvalho e Silva (European Portuguese), Jan Simek (Czech), Stefan Billik
(Slovak), Laszlo Nemeth (Hungarian), Andrej Zizmond (Slovene), and Alex
Mihaila (Romanian).

<p>
Finally, thanks to you for using the program!
