<h2>Upgrading from earlier versions</h2>

This page lists those commands which existed in older versions of analog, but
which have been changed or abolished in this version. The new features in this
version are listed on the page <cite><a href="whatsnew.html">What's new in
this version?</a></cite>.

<h2>Upgrading from 2.90beta1</h2>
<ul>
  <li><kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT</kbd> has been replaced by
      <kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-NA</kbd> and <kbd>LOGFORMAT MICROSOFT-INT</kbd>;
      and similarly for <kbd>LOGFORMAT NETPRESENZ</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.11 and earlier</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible that there may be small discrepancies between the results
      from previous versions and the results from this version because the
      parsing code has changed, but any such differences should be minor.
      However...
  <li>If you used to use <kbd>REFEXCLUDE</kbd> or <kbd>BROWEXCLUDE</kbd>, you
      most likely now want <kbd><a href="include.html">REFREPEXCLUDE</a></kbd>
      or <kbd><a href="include.html">BROWREPEXCLUDE</a></kbd> instead, or you
      will exclude lots of lines that were previously included.
  <li>It is possible that this version may not automatically parse a logfile
      that previous versions could parse, because it checks more carefully
      that the logfile is in the format claimed. If so, you will have to use a
      <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFORMAT</a></kbd> command.
  <li>Approximate host counting has been abolished, unless there's a
      significant demand for it.
  <li>The Error Report has been abolished (together with the configuration
      commands <kbd>ERROR</kbd>, <kbd>ERRLOG</kbd> and <kbd>ERRMINOCCS</kbd>).
      See the <cite><a href="whatsnew.html">What's new?</a></cite> page.
  <li>The <kbd>BROWLOG</kbd> and <kbd>REFLOG</kbd> commands have also been
      abolished: just use <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFILE</a></kbd>
      instead.
  <li>The <kbd>HASHSIZE</kbd> commands have been abolished: analog now chooses
      the size of the hash tables itself.
  <li>The <kbd>MINREQS</kbd> and similar options have been replaced by the
      <kbd><a href="othreps.html">FLOOR</a></kbd> commands.
  <li>Only one <kbd>*</kbd> is now allowed on the left-hand side of aliases,
      to avoid ambiguities.
  <li>Automatic detection of log type is now on a per-file rather than a
      per-line basis.
  <li><kbd>ISPAGE</kbd> is now called
      <kbd><a href="include.html">PAGEINCLUDE</a></kbd>.
  <li><kbd>WITHARGS</kbd> and <kbd>REFWITHARGS</kbd> are now called
      <kbd><a href="include.html">ARGSINCLUDE</a></kbd> and
      <kbd><a href="include.html">REFARGSINCLUDE</a></kbd>.
  <li><kbd>MONTHLYBACK</kbd> is now called <kbd>MONTHBACK</kbd>, and
      <kbd>MONTHLYUNIT</kbd> is now called <kbd>MONTHUNIT</kbd> (and the same
      for the other <a href="timereps.html">time reports</a>).
  <li><kbd>FULLHOSTS</kbd> is now just called <kbd>HOST</kbd>.
  <li><kbd>LASTSEVEN</kbd> is abolished: you get the statistics for the last
      seven days in the General Summary automatically now.
  <li><kbd>LOGOURL</kbd> is now called <kbd>LOGO</kbd>, and is assumed to be
      within the <kbd><a href="output.html">IMAGEDIR</a></kbd>.
  <li>The <kbd>UNIT</kbd> commands have been abolished. They weren't very
      useful, and they didn't make much sense with the different ways of
      displaying the time report bar charts. The unit is now always chosen
      automatically.
  <li><kbd>DIRLEVEL</kbd> has been abolished, because the
      <kbd><a href="hierreps.html">SUBDIR</a></kbd> command is more general.
      Use <kbd>SUBDIR */*</kbd> or whatever instead.
  <li>Comments aren't allowed in the <a href="domfile.html">domains file</a>.
      I don't think this should cause a problem.
  <li><kbd>BASEURL</kbd> is abolished. Use the second argument to the
      <kbd><a href="logfile.html">LOGFILE</a></kbd> command as a close
      alternative.
  <li><kbd>GRAPHICAL</kbd> is abolished. Instead, use lower case letters with
      the <kbd>GRAPH</kbd> commands.
  <li><kbd>NUMLOOKUP</kbd> has been replaced by
      <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNS</a></kbd>, and <kbd>DNSFRESHHOURS</kbd>
      by the commands <kbd><a href="dns.html">DNSGOODHOURS and
      DNSBADHOURS</a></kbd>.
  <li>DNS cache files from previous versions are not compatible with this
      version.
  <li>You can't use <kbd>PAGES</kbd> in the columns or <kbd>SORTBY</kbd> or
      <kbd>FLOOR</kbd> for the Request Report. Use <kbd>REQINCLUDE pages</kbd>
      instead.
  <li><kbd>-</kbd> as a synonym for <kbd>none</kbd> has been abolished in some
      places, e.g., <kbd>HOSTURL</kbd>.
  <li>The following command line arguments have been abolished from earlier
      versions, many of the letters getting new meanings: <kbd>7</kbd>,
      <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>,
      <kbd>v</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>. (<kbd>-v</kbd> has moved to
      <kbd>-settings</kbd>.) Others have been changed since version 1.2 as
      well.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 2.0, Win32 users</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Filenames for logfiles etc. should now be given DOS-style, with
      backslashes, rather than Unix-style with forward slashes.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.92 and earlier, Mac users</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There is no longer an automatic progress report. Use the
     <kbd><a href="debug.html">PROGRESSFREQ</a></kbd> command instead.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.9beta's</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use <kbd><a href="include.html">REQINCLUDE</a></kbd> and
      <kbd><a href="include.html">LINKINCLUDE</a></kbd> instead of
      <kbd>REQTYPE</kbd> and <kbd>PAGELINKS</kbd>.
</ul>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.2's and earlier</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="include.html"><kbd>*INCLUDE</kbd> and
      <kbd>*EXCLUDE</kbd></a> instead of <kbd>*ONLY</kbd> and
      <kbd>*IGNORE</kbd>.
  <li>The syntax of the <kbd>*FLOOR</kbd> commands has changed.
  <li>Use <kbd>*SORTBY REQUESTS</kbd> or <kbd>BYTES</kbd> instead of
      <kbd>*SORTBY BYREQUESTS</kbd> or <kbd>BYBYTES</kbd>.
</ul>
