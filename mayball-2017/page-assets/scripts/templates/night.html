<!--
--><p>The Jesus May Ball Committee is delighted to invite you to weave Between the Lines of our evening of literary discovery and adventure by joining us at the 2017 Jesus May Ball. Defeat a dragon, fall in love, and brave a gothic potion as you explore this year's extravaganza.</p><!--
--><p>Prepare to experience a night like no other. As the sun sets on Jesus College on the 19<sup>th</sup> June, stroll freely across the ancient courts. Here you can sample a wide range of food from across the world, help yourself to a delicious cocktail or grab a glass of fizz, before settling down to catch some of our carefully selected acts. Or, if you desire a different pace, hurtle around in the dodgems and dance the night away in our DJ tent.</p><!--
--><p>However you wish to spend your night, Jesus May Ball has something for you.</p>
