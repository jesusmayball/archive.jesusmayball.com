						--><p>Please be aware that Jesus College May Ball does not operate a half-on half-off system. You may be invited for an interview and we will contact you if your application is successful, providing further information about your role. The standard shift time for workers is from 19:00 - 05:00 with two unpaid 30 minute breaks, although these might be altered depending on your role. Please note that all workers will be expected at Jesus College by 16:00 on the evening of the ball (Monday 19th June 2017) to allow time for sign-in, a walk-through of the grounds, briefing, training, and to help in the final set-up for the ball. All workers will be expected to sign in again at 05:00 before leaving the ball. Workers must also attend one short training session at Jesus College, provisionally scheduled for Sunday 11th June (1pm-3pm), Monday 12th June (10am-12am) and Tuesday 13th June (6pm-8pm). Attendance at one of these sessions is compulsory. All employees at Jesus College May Ball will be required to read a contract (which stipulates the terms and conditions of employment), sign it and return it to us. We will also require a passport photo of each worker and two £75 cheques made payable to "Jesus College May Ball". These are to cover any minor or major breaches of contract but will otherwise be destroyed after the ball on fulfilment of the employment.</p><!--
