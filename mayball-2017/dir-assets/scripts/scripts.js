Dive to the depths of the ocean, brave the toxic wasteland, and try not to get lost in the swamp as we take you to the extremities of this world (and beyond).</p> <p>Venture to Jesus College and prepare to experience the night of your life as our historic grounds are transformed. Quench your thirst with a refreshing cocktail or ice-cold glass of fizz if the heat of the desert gets too much, and should you end up in outer space be sure to sample our out of this world food. As the sun sets, wrap up warm and prepare to chill out to some mellow tones in the Antarctic, or if you desire something more upbeat, see if you can stand the pressure as we invite you to dance the night away in the centre of the earth.</p> <p>However you wish to spend your night, there will be something for you in the Uninhabitable.</p> </div> <img src=\"dir-assets/img/purpBall.jpg\"> </div> </div> <div class=\"split\"></div> <div class=\"section\" id=\"ents\"> <h2>ENTERTAINMENT</h2> <div class=\"content\"> <img src=\"dir-assets/img/Garratt.jpg\"> <img id=\"ents_image2\" src=\"dir-assets/img/Phase.jpg\"> <p>Jesus May Ball is pleased to announce that 2016 Brit Award Winner and Sound of 2016,<br><strong>Jack Garratt</strong> will be headlining this year's Ball.<br>Following in the footsteps of last year's headline act, James Bay, Jack was decorated as the 'Critics Choice' at this year's Brits and with his new album, Phase, already making waves he is set to have an incredibly successful summer.<br>That summer will start at Jesus May Ball on 13th June.</p> <img src=\"dir-assets/img/cleanbandit.jpg\"> <img id=\"ents_image2\" src=\"dir-assets/img/neil.jpg\"> <p><strong>Clean Bandit</strong> are one of the biggest bands in the world, while their hit singles ‘Rather Be’ and ‘Real Love’ are some of the most played of all time.
