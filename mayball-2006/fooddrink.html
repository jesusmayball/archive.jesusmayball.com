      <p>There will be something to tempt every palate at <em>Never Never Land</em>. From luxury puddings and hand made chocolates to specialist cheeses, the ball will provide not only the traditional favourites but more exotic fayre too.</p>
      <p>To really start the ball in style why not take advantage of the sumptuous three course dinner with wine and port offered with our <a href="dining.html">dining option?</a></p>
      <p>Thirst ought not to be something experienced by guests either. At the 2005 ball we did not run dry, so be assured you will certainly get your fill! The customary May Week offering of Pimms and champagne will be plentiful, alongside refreshments such as cocktails, both soft and alcoholic, beers, wines and more.</p>
