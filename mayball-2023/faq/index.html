    <div class="text question" id="q1">
        <h2>I'M ON THE WAITING LIST… NOW WHAT?</h2>
        <p>If any spare tickets become available, we will contact people on the waiting list on a first come, first served basis. You'll stay on the waiting list until a few weeks before the ball, to give you the best chance of getting a ticket.</p>

        <h2>CAN I CHANGE THE NAME ON MY TICKET?</h2>
        <p>Name changes on tickets can be done here, for a fee of £40, however this fee will increase to £50 after the 22nd April. Changes will be made to the tickets after payment confirmation. The deadline for all name change requests is the 6th June. This is a strict deadline, and no exceptions will be given.</p>

        <h2>I HAVE SPECIFIC DIETARY REQUIREMENTS - WILL THESE BE CATERED TO AT THE BALL?</h2>
        <p>The menus for the night have been selected with the utmost care to cater for a wide range of dietary requirements, so we hope there will be something for everyone. If you have purchased a dining ticket, an email regarding dietary requirements will be sent to you. If you have any more specific questions, feel free to contact the Food Officer at <a href="mailto:food@jesusmayball.com">food@jesusmayball.com</a>. Additionally, allergen information will be included in the electronic program.</p>

    <div class="text question" id="q1">
        <h2>I HAVE SPECIFIC ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS - WILL THESE BE ACCOMMODATED?</h2>
        <p>We will be in touch via email over the coming months with information on how to let us know your requirements, but you may find the following information useful in the interim. The Ball will be based around several college courts, with an accessible entrance to the Ball via the Chimney. Whilst most of the Ball can be navigated using paved paths, there are some wood-chip paths, uncovered grassy areas and cobbled floors, ramps over electrical cables, and carpeted grass areas slightly raised from the ground. Additionally, there is a staircase up to the Hall area, although we are able to provide a stair-lift entrance. We will be publishing an accessibility map before the ball, and hard copies of this will be available on the night at the entrance. If you require any more information in advance, or need any special provisions made, please email president@jesusmayball.com. Additionally, the Main Hall will be open all night with gentle acoustic music and a calm atmosphere for those who may need to take a few minutes away from noise or bright lights. This is a spacious area with an accessible entrance via the lift.</p>

    <div class="text question" id="q1">
        <h2>WHAT'S YOUR ETHICAL BANKING POLICY?</h2>
        <p>Ethical banking and sustainability considerations form an integral part of Jesus College May Ball’s values, having been certified Platinum by Sustain-a-ball in previous years for our efforts towards making the ball as sustainable as possible. The committee wants to engage in constructive conversations in order to further our already broad ranging strategies, and as part of this we have intensely scrutinised the ways we bank our money to ensure we bank responsibly.</p>
        <p>As a provider of a large scale event, the committee often has large sums of cash needing to be deposited in the short term. When making decisions about where to deposit this cash, the committee considered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The range of banks that provided instant access business and associated savings accounts</li>
            <li>The status of these banks as ‘ethical’ investors (primarily, their lending, underwriting, and investing policies)</li>
            <li>The ability of these banks to handle high volumes of payments</li>
            <li>Whether or not these banks had the infrastructure and legal protections in place to accommodate the size of the Ball’s deposits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Jesus College May Ball holds a comparatively tiny amount of cash in banks relative to larger corporations, however we commit to engaging with our bankers, alongside other organisations with similar goals, to lobby for them to adopt policies in line with Sustain-a-ball’s overall mission. Financial institutions deemed in the opinion of the committee to not be taking active steps to divest and take steps towards the introduction of ethical banking policies will be considered unfavourably when the committee makes future decisions regarding its deposits.</p>
