$text[]="<font style='font-size: smaller;'>Please note that the tickets are strictly non-transferable and non-refundable save in circumstances deemed to be sufficiently acceptable by the Jesus College May Ball Committee ('the Committee'). The Committee reserves the right to refuse any application for tickets. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to refuse entry of any ticket-holder to the May Ball or eject any ticket-holder from the May Ball where the committee and/or its duly authorised representatives have reasonable grounds to believe the ticket-holder may have committed or may be about to commit a criminal offence or has engaged or is engaging in other such activities as the Committee deems unacceptable. The Committee reserves the right to conduct searches to verify if grounds for such beliefs exist. Furthermore, the Committee reserves the right to make reasonable alterations to the programme of the May Ball without notice to the ticket-holders. All decisions of the Committee are final. Queries should be made either by post to May Ball Committee, Jesus College, Cambridge, CB5 8BL, or email Timothy Little on <a href='mailto: mayball-president@jesus.cam.ac.uk'>mayball-president@jesus.cam.ac.uk</a></font>";
