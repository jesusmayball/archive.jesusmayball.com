$text[]="<h1>Kubla Khan</h1>";
$text[]="<h3>Or, a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment.</h3>";
$text[]="In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br/>
A stately pleasure-dome decree: <br/>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran <br/>
Through caverns measureless to man <br/>
Down to a sunless sea. <br/>
So twice five miles of fertile ground <br/>
With walls and towers were girdled round:<br/> 
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br/> 
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; <br/>
And here were forests ancient as the hills, <br/>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br/>";
$text[]="But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted <br/>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! <br/>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted <br/>
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted <br/>
By woman wailing for her demon-lover! <br/>
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, <br/>
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, <br/>
A mighty fountain momently was forced: <br/>
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst <br/>
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, <br/>
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail: <br/>
And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever <br/>
It flung up momently the sacred river. <br/>
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion <br/>
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, <br/>
Then reached the caverns measureless to man, <br/>
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: <br/>
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far <br/>
Ancestral voices prophesying war! <br/>
The shadow of the dome of pleasure <br/>
Floated midway on the waves; <br/>
Where was heard the mingled measure <br/>
From the fountain and the caves. <br/>";
$text[]="It was a miracle of rare device, <br/>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br/>";
$text[]="A damsel with a dulcimer <br/>
In a vision once I saw: <br/>
It was an Abyssinian maid, <br/>
And on her dulcimer she played, <br/>
Singing of Mount Abora. <br/>
Could I revive within me <br/>
Her symphony and song, <br/>
To such a deep delight 'twould win me, <br/>";
$text[]="That with music loud and long, <br/>
I would build that dome in air, <br/>
That sunny dome! those caves of ice! <br/>
And all who heard should see them there, <br/>
And all should cry, Beware! Beware! <br/>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair! <br/>
Weave a circle round him thrice, <br/>
And close your eyes with holy dread, <br/>
For he on honey-dew hath fed, <br/>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.<br/>";
